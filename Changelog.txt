	- The lit fixes for minorities that SHOULD be literate but weren't (I did remove the bad word though)

	- Gave Senj and Karlovac from Old Croatia to Dalmatia
	- Merged Arabian states into two

	- Added a STATUE OF LIBERTY to the new world, can be constructed for 500K, and can be stolen via a CB that costs 24 warscore
	- Imported ship costs from IgoR_PRF (makes ships a tad more expensive goods wise, some steamers cost coal and/or canned goods)

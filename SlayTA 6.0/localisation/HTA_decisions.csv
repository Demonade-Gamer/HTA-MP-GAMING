annexation_of_saxony_title;The Annexation of Saxony;x
annexation_of_saxony_desc;Saxony failed to take part in the Brunswick Congress, but they must not be allowed to remain outside the German question.

approach_aqt_title;Approach Aquitï¿½nia;;;;;;;;;x
approach_aqt_desc;Both powers on the Italian peninsula have expressed a territorial interest in our islands.

aquitanian_zased_desc;The situation is untennable in Aquitania, the populace is on the verge of open revolt! Luckily, it seems the military is weary from their experience in Hispania, and will not resist a Liberal Takeover (should we avoid the mistakes of our comrades in Toledo). Our new world colonies will be left in disarray unfortuantely, and likely nearby powers (or the French) will absorb them, but that is a small sacrifice we are willing to make. Let us storm the Palace and proclaim a Revolutionary Republique!;x

While this will limit the power of the crown, it's clear that if we do not do something we will suffer the same fate as the Andrades in Hispania;x
austria_german_title;Improve Austrian Infrastructure;x
austria_german_desc;While the Southern Germans are a proud people, they have fallen well behind the rest of the German nations in the last 300 years and have become something of a backwater.

bohemian_zadar_title;The Zadar Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;x
bohemian_zadar_desc;Bohemia is one of the most powerful and industrialised countries in the world, yet we are landlocked and dependent on our neighbours to conduct international trade. We should change this. Having a warm relationship as we do, perhaps we could propose that Croatia lease us that port in Zadar, and we will, in return, fund railroads which both we and they can use, as well as giving them a sum of money. Our ministers expect that approximately 25,000 will be sufficient to sway them.;;;;;;;;;;;x

boukoleon_restoration_desc;The Boukoleon Palace was the residence of the Emperors of the Roman Empire from the 11th century until the 16th century, when it was damaged by Armenian occupations during the many wars when the Empire was on its back foot at the height of Muslim power. Since then, it has stood in ruins, as the Emperors have had other concerns. Restore and rebuild the palace to beautify and glorify our city!;;;;;;;;;;;x

call_brunswick_congress_desc;Given the recent Bavarian violation of Mainzer sovereignty, it is clear that the king in Mï¿½nich does not intend to abide by the terms of the Peace of Augsburg.

call_brunswick_congress2_title;Call the Brunswick Congress of Germans;;;;;;;;x
call_brunswick_congress2_desc;Agitation among the inhabitants of the various states of the old Holy Roman Empire has been increasing recently. Calls for German unification and a rising sense of kinship that transcends political borders has caused some unrest among the people because of the rivalries of the princes. We should call delegates from around the north to discuss the situation. External threats are another concern that will weigh heavily on delegates' minds and we will likely see many states banding together politically.;;;;;;;;;;x

cede_emden_desc;With the failure of the diplomatic option in the proposed Emden Accords with our German neighbour, we are faced with a difficult decision. Tensions over the city will only continue to mount, and we must ask ourselves if we want to risk war to hold such a small region.

celt_USR_title;Liberate the Celts of the New World;x
celt_USR_desc;The Aenglisc were known to expell celts to their colonies in their bid to fully Anglisize the Isles. One of the main destinations was the land of Uilscyr.

celt_immigrants_title;Adopt Uilsc Institutions;x
celt_immigrants_desc;While we've been understandably leery of Liberalism: they still call themselves after their failed attempt to overthrow our monarchy afterall, if we wish to resettled Uilsc and reform it in our image, we need to open the borders to new colonists.\n\nÂ§GThis will make you an South American Immigrant Nation.;x

cisalpines_are_aquitanian_desc;The Cisalpine people of Padania speak a language none too far removed from our own, and have long been part of our cultural and economic history.

claim_balearics_title;Claim the Balearic Islands;;;;;;;x
claim_balearics_desc;The Balearic Islands of Mallorca and Menorca have long held an important position in the trading of the western end of the Mediterranean, and acquiring them would bolster our reputation and ability to control and conduct trade in that region.

claim_bar_lorraine_title;Claim Bar and Lorraine;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_bar_lorraine_desc;The French crown's ownership of Bar and Lorraine can be traced back to the time of Charlemagne. The two duchies were part of the Holy Roman Empire, but, being on its periphery, never were an integral part, and remained neutral in the Imperial War. They are populated by French-speaking peoples, and our spies tell us there is some support for joining us. Other countries may laugh at our claim, but we will take Bar and Lorraine for ourselves!

claim_brittany_desc;We have long been sundered from our brothers on the European continent, proud descendants of the last holdouts from the Romans, and last holdouts of our once-numerous and great people on the continent.

claim_rose_title;Claim Rosï¿½;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_rose_desc;Daufinat has chosen to join the Padan Union, but this is primarily because of the Cisalpine inhabitants of the Piemont.

claim_zeeland_title;Claim Zeeland;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_zeeland_desc;Being a great and powerful nation, others will surely not deny that we are the rightful owners of Zeeland. Indeed, some of the towns and cities of the region expressed interest in joining our kingdom when we united in 1814.

develop_land_MEX_desc;With the conquest of our enemies across the continent, now is the time to look inwards. Mexika is a centralized state, but with strong regional tendencies. Rather than just focusing on the core of the nation, we can, through use of infrastructure subsidies and targeted investment, encourage the growth of our smaller provincial capitals. This will help balance growth and combat inequality.;x

dissolve_old_duchy_CMP_desc;Now that we have claimed the throne of France, the Duchy of Champagne should pass from a legitimate title of power to one merely of respect.

dominate_the_kazakhs_desc;The vast steppes and deserts of Central Asia will not for long present the buffer they once did. Indeed, they present an opportunity for $COUNTRY$. By controlling this land, we may derive (in time) economic gain, but more importantly, it could represent a stepping stone to further imperial ambitions to the south. Imagine $COUNTRY_ADJ$ ports on the Indian Ocean. We must have this land. Let us establish more direct control over the tribes, and organize them into a proper government, directed by us, of course.;x

embrace_femboy_title;Accept Slovenes;x
embrace_femboy_desc;The Slovenes have long lived peacefully under our rule. They really are just Austrians who decided to LARP as Slavs but did it too hard and forgot our language. By calling them equals and allowing them use of their language in Slovenia proper, we will earn their adoration and simultaneously make governance easier.;;;;;;;;;;x

embrace_maretans_desc;The Marenan people are few and confined to their islands, but they are a proud race with a long history of self-reliance and self-sufficience.

However, by allowing some regional autonomy and making a sincere effort to respect their culture, we might forge a new era of cooperation between the Spanish and Portuguese people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_romansh_title;Protect Romansh People;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_romansh_desc;The Romansh people are a small minority we inherited after annexing Helvetia. Too few to have their own country, members of local Romansh communities have petitioned our government for official protection, as was the case under the Helvetian government. They cite their strong ethnic and cultural ties to Germany - despite their strange language -, as well as their past services to Helvetia, which they would gladly pass to us as their new rulers should we allow them the same rights as proper Germans. Offering protection to such a petty minority might demean a country as great as ours, but would be looked up favorably in the eyes of foreign moralists, as well as helping to restore a sense of normalcy to the former Helvetian cantons.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
embrace_sicilians_title;Embrace the Sicilians;;;;;;;;;x

embrace_slovaks_desc;The Slovaks have long lived peacefully under our rule. Almost identical in language and culture, their separate identity stems more from geography than anything else.

enlist_tatars_title;The Kazan Pact - Kazanskii Dogovor;;;;;;;;;;;;x
enlist_tatars_desc;The more populous crown of Smolensk, which falsely claims to be heir to Russia, has many more soldiers than do we. There is, however, opportunity. The Tatars, the once-feared horselords of the steppe, are divided subjects of both countries. If we curry favour with them, we may be able to destabilize Smolensk, allowing us to defeat them. By accepting the Kazani Tatars as equals, we may gain an important advantage with all of the inhabitants of the steppe. However, stories of their cruelty remain and the other peoples of our empire may not be so happy.;;;;;;;;;;x

establish_la_guardia_civil_desc;'El Cuerpo Nacional de Carabineros', Spanish for 'The National Carabiniers', is the Hispanian gendarmerie corps, established during the reign of Lope II in the aftermath of the bloody Red Years. Although foreign intervention crushed the Revolution and restored the Monarchy, Albesan sympathies lingered in the countryside and some cities, with some areas never fully pacified. It is in this context that the Carabiniers were born, a mixed police-military force with far-reaching powers to pacify the restive populace and maintain the monarchical order.;x

expand_halesca_desc;Given Skamisc and other countries' ambitions in North Magallania, it seems prudent to claim the land all the way to the Skamisc border at the 141st parallel. That way, none can try to sneak around us, and we can exploit the resources to be found in our rich, if far-flung, colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

form_zachadia_desc;Philologists have confirmed what we have already long known: that the Poles, Czechs, Silesians, Slovaks, and Sorbs all speak closely related languages, which have come to be called the Western Slavic family. Given our cultural, linguistic, and geographical proximity, we could unite our peoples into a great nation.\n\nNOTE! Western Slavs must control Silesian and Polish cores (Slovakia can be owned by them, or Hungary can be puppeted. If you don't want to puppet the country(ies) owning Slovak cores, just sphere them and get Revolution and Counterrevolution). Prague/Bohemia must be sphered and puppeted with +100 relations (or you can just own Prague).

This body has met semi-annually for six weeks since time immemorial. A democratic body, it stands in stark opposition to the more absolutist methods of rule Poland's neighbours employ. The involvement of nobility tends to guarantee their investment in the well-being of the state, and this has effects beyond the legislation the body produces: each member ensures that the land he owns is as prosperous as can be.;x

incite_ukrainians_desc;The Ukrainians have long had a separate identity from the Great Russians, even those of Smolensk.

info_BRI_desc;Celts and Aenglisc have competing accepted on each other, however they cannot get full accepted on the other: Celts can never get Aenglisc and Albina won't get Irish. After the battle for the Isles is settled, Celts will get Breton accepted which is spread out more in France, and Albina is stuck on the isles, loser. Also be wary of Scandi! They get scottish now!;x
info_BYZ_desc;Epic East Rome LARP. You first need to reclaim your land from the many breakaway states Next, you will be able to invade Italy and get Italian, Sicilian, and Bulgarian accepted! Also Persia will be creeping in on Anatolia, so choose which threat, Italy or Persia, to focus on first!

info_NPL_title;HtA Naples Info;x
info_NA_desc;3 nations in North America are competing formables even if they don't look like it at first: Skamisc/Magaria, Mexika, and Hoyekysten (technically in South America but whatever) can all get accepted and cores on each other and likely will be stuck in death wars for years. Meanwhile, Vestland has a chill game of uniting the north and not much reason to involve themselves in death wars: Although they do get Magarian and Afro-Magallanian accepted so securing that may be worth the trouble. Another notable event is that around 1885 if the Shawneee Confederation is destroyed and is not on the map, their cores will be removed. This will allow you to assimilate the land way faster! Shawnee is not recommended nation to roster or play, although I added a few events and decisions for them. Namely they can get a research buff or a giga general early game (only applies to players) and when they civ their pop growth is nerfed a bit, but they get a Mob and Assim buff.;x
info_NET_title;HtA Netherland Info;x
info_NET_desc;Unlike Netherlands in Vanilla, you likely will need to make hard decisions and alliances in Europe As you are near Britain, France, Aquitania, and the Germans and you also have competing claims and cores in Wallonia with France, also getting French, so hopefully you win that! Otherwise though, be sure to keep your two colonies and conquer all of South Afrika's cores as these can be buffed up later in the game. You get the ability to raise the liferating in all your European provinces if you conquer all french cores! However, if you end up losing, you can flee to South Africa and try to scale up from there!

info_PER_desc;This Persia is buffed to shit, as you are Rome's natural enemy at the start of the game. You'll get Azerbaijani and Pashtun accepted. You will also get Mashriqi and Bedouin accepted in 1845, with the potential to get Armenian and Kurdish accepted if you have all their cores! You also start the game with a 1 mil pop puppet in Syria, if you can't tell, which you will annex either in 1845 when you get mashriqi and bedouin. However, due to your low literacy you will very quickly fall off.;x
info_POL_title;HtA Poland Info;x
info_POL_desc;Zachadia is a West Slavic super state that can be formed by either Poland or Bohemia. Bohemia keeps Hungarian while Poland keeps Ashkanazi. Right now they are competing formables, but Demonade disabled alternate paths for each nation where they don't have to kill each other. This may be enabled at a later time.;x
info_RUS_title;HtA Russia Info;x
info_RUS_desc;While the Civil War seems lopsided from raw pop numbers, you're actually evenly matched with Smolensk. Your main issue will be dealing with Zachadia and Finland trying to intervene in your civil war to snipe land off you. Right now the only differences between the formables is the choice between Tartar or Urgian, you both will be able to get Ukranian, Ruthenian, and Byelorussian and Ashkenazi. You also will get a baby boom in Siberia after colonizing it, up to Perm and Samara.;x
info_SA_title;HtA South America Info;x
info_SA_desc;Technically there's only 2 real South American nations: Uilscyr and Argentina. They of course, are competing nations who get accepted on each other. Argentina gets Afro-Latino and Andean as a bonus while Uilscyr gets Afro-Antillean, Afro-Uilsc, and Afro-Carribean. Unfortunately you do not get cores on each other so you have to kill each other the old fashioned way. In 1885 if the Inca do not exist on the map their cores will be removed, allowing you to assimilate Incan land quickly. Inca is not recommended as a rostered nation although I gave them Andean at least I guess, they also get the same pop growth nerf when civving that Shawnee do.;x
info_SCA_title;HtA Scandinavia Info;x
info_SCA_desc;Sweden is an optional roster, but they basically get Scottish accepted, This may seem like a bad deal, leaving you far weaker than any formed isles nation, but at least you'll have a higher literacy.;x
info_SML_title;HtA Smolensk Info;x
info_SML_desc;While the Civil War seems heavily in your favor from raw pop numbers, you're actually evenly matched with Russia. Your main issue will be dealing with Zachadia and Finland trying to intervene in your civil war to snipe land off you...or off Russia. After killing Russia you will be able to form 'The Russian Empire' which basically just makes you Russia. Right now the only differences between the formables is the choice between Tartar or Urgian, you both will be able to get Ukranian, Ruthenian, and Byelorussian and Ashkenazi. You also will get a baby boom in Siberia after colonizing it, up to Perm and Samara.;x
info_TER_title;HtA Teralarga Info;x
info_TER_desc;Oh, you're playing the AFK nation. Cool. In all seriousness though, your main bonus for playing this nation is that I've added straits to allow you to move to New Zeeland and Papua New Guinea. This means you can get these all as connected ports! You can't get connected to Indonesia however, but you start in Hispania's sphere and he likely may want to support you as a Dominion.;x
inland_claims_title;Our Inland Claims;;;;;;;;;;;x
inland_claims_desc;Uilscyr has been making plans to go up and claim the far reaches of the tributaries of the Jordrac River. This would bring them uncomfortably close to our territory. We should beat them to the punch, and maybe we'll discover some useful and interesting things in these lands.;;;;;;;;;;x
integrate_cymru_title;Integrate Cymru;;;;;;;;x
integrate_cymru_desc;It was only in 1829 that the Duke of Cymru, Owain of Aberdaugleddau, made his realm subservient to ours, in a moment of diplomatic clarity. However, recent events between our two countries and a changing diplomatic situation abroad necessitate that we establish direct control over the Cymraeg lands.

We were worried they'd be livid about us, frankly, throwing them under the bus but we've gotten great news: It seems they could not decide who should rule so they went with the neutral choice: They've invited our prime minister to be given the title of Shogun, and offered their vassalage! Our conversion of Japan has finally paid off!;x

It further stated the ambition of the Padan Union to annex the Romagna region into its territory, given its proximity to the namesake Po River.

norwegian_caribbean_title;Issue the Declaration of Kajahikos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
norwegian_caribbean_desc;For a great many years the king in Anslo had been forced to accept the sovereignty of various elected legislative bodies due to the strictures of the Constitution of 1822, which was ultimately accepted by the royal family under duress. However, the alignment of many of those legislative bodies with the destabilizing forces of Albesanism and the subsequent royal coup, which saw members of the royal family and the solidly absolutist army and navy dissolve the liberal constitution, have rendered the king a free hand in Norway. With support for the royals and Nordic nationalism both at an all-time high, and the Norwegian Navy quite large and abundantly capable of projecting force in the region, Olav Erling, the Duke of Faroe, has traveled to the Norwegian-held island of Kajahikos and, acting on orders from his elder brother King Hï¿½kon IV, proclaimed the intent of the Norwegian Crown to annex the islands of Firgene, Heymak, Curasu, and Welighefen by right of conquest.

vyazma_march_desc;After our recent victory, Smolensk is weak: its government is collapsing, what few troops it has are barely paid, and its people are rebelling. They are in no position to repel our troops, truce be damned. Let us dispatch an army immediately down the road across the border to Vyazma, and thence to Smolensk! We can end this in one bold, fell swoop!\n\nNOTE: This will end the chain just the same as winning another war or them falling to rebels, but is probably pretty unlikely to happen. If you don't get the opportunity to take this decision, oh well!;x

window_to_the_west_LAT_title;Window to the West - Latvia;;;;;;;;;;x
window_to_the_west_LAT_desc;Our great country lies so close to the Baltic Sea, yet has no access. Securing a port would allow us to enrich our lands and project our power better against rivals on our western frontier. The newly-independent Latvia is a perfect possibility. Their economy is small and they need aid in modernising. With just a small cash infusion, we could gain important influence that could be used to establish our control over the country, and, most importantly, its coastline.;;;;;;;;;;;x

window_to_the_west_LIT_desc;Our great country lies so close to the Baltic Sea, yet has no access. Securing a port would allow us to enrich our lands and project our power better against rivals on our western frontier. Lithuania, a state long on the fringes of Europe, has somehow avoided much attention from Poland and Finland. Their economy is small and they need aid in modernising. With just a small cash infusion, we could gain important influence that could then be used to establish formal control over the country and, most importantly, its coastline.;;;;;;;;;;x
yoke_the_tatars_title;Yoke the Tatars;x
yoke_the_tatars_desc;While they were a useful ally during the war to unify Great Russia, it is no longer necessary to allow them the autonomy they demand. They are simply no longer necessary as allies, and so it is time to force them to settle for good. Just as the Tatars once shackled us, we shall now shackle them and integrate them into our new empire. They will not go quietly, but they will go.;x
ZAC_inherits_LUZ_title;The Destiny of Luzica;x
ZAC_inherits_LUZ_desc;Beyond the Odra river lies Luzica, the homeland of the Sorbs, the last remnant of the Slavs that once inhabited all the region from Silesia to Denmark. They have been increasingly marginalized while living in German states, and it is time for us to change that. And we are in a position to do so. Let us welcome them into Zachadia!;x
ZAC_inherits_RUT_title;Our Brothers, the Ruthenians;x
ZAC_inherits_RUT_desc;Though their language may not be quite as close to ours as that of the Silesians or Sorbs, the peoples of Zachadia have had much historical contact with the Ruthenians, which has been to the profit of all our peoples. Now that we find ourselves in a position to exert our influence in the region, we should consider incorporating the rich Ruthenian lands into our great nation. Let all share in its bounty!;x

ZAC_POL_PLC_title;A Commonwealth of Brethren;x
ZAC_POL_PLC_desc;The Byelorussians and Lithuanians are not West Slavs like us, but they have had constant contact and even protection by Poland throughout history. We should protect our historic friends from the Tsar or the Perfidious Finnish!;x
fuck_condor_title;An empire of our own.;;;;;;;;;;x
fuck_condor_desc;Volasea is the name of our nation and our people: with the threat of the Byzantines from the south constantly trying to annex or dominate us, we did not see it fit to call ourselves 'Romanians'.

claim_aengland_desc;Recent Archeological discoveries and breakthroughs by Anthropoligists (sponsored by us, clearly not biased) have confirmed what we already know: That the so called 'Aenglisc' people are really Britons who adopted their tongue, there was no such mass migration of Angles and Jutes to the isles. With our domination of the Prydain, we will confirm this fact and restore the Celtic tongue to our long lost brethren!;x

annex_quebec_desc;Named after the first true european to discover and settle Magallania, Leifsland is one of the least populated Northern Norwegian colonies, and they suffer from constant raids from the Shawnee.

form_sultanate_of_rum_desc;As we have adopted some Turkish and Greco-Roman ideas into our society we have seen it fit to revive an empire of our own. The seat of our glorious realm, spanning all classical societies shall be sat on the city founded as a crossroads of ideas. Constantinople's corpse will be reborn into Neo-Hayastan, becoming a city of Armenian strength but with the roots of our new empire intact. The empire shall be christened as such, The imperium of Rum, a Sultanic state that has adopted a blend of Christian and Islamic peoples that unite under our flag in the name of our Lord. We have chosen a Turkic name to represent the blend of history that our nation stands upon without favouring any one group since the turks are more of a distant memory that we can all admire. This is a new meaning for the abbreviation for SPQR.;;;;;;;;;;x

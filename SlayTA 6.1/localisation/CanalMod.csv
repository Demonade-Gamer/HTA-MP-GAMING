The canal was practically finished, and it was to test the navigability that the Palatia was sent through. She touched bottom several times, but did not stick fast and sustained no damage.

EVTDESC185918695;Today armed Bedouins have started a revolt among our workers at the Suez Canal and construction was halted until further notice. We suspect the Aenglisc are behind this, they opposed our project from the beginning accusing us of using slave labor. The true reason is of course that the canal is a threat to their strategic interests. We have no other choice but to abolish Corvée (a form of unpaid labor) to resume the project. Unfortunately this affair will cost us dearly, both finacially and timewise.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC1859186910;Work on the Suez Canal started in 1859 and was completed in 1869. It connects the Mediterranean with the Red Sea and shortens the journey between Europa and Asia drastically. More than 30,000 peope were working on the canal at any given moment and thousands of labourers died on the project. The financial cost was over 100,000,000 dollars, more than double the initial estimate.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190419147;The Mellom Canal joins the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, replacing the long and treacherous route around South Ameriga. Construction was first started in 1880 by the Aengland but later abandoned due to technical problems, financial mismanagement and a high deathtoll of 22,000 thanks to tropical diseases. In 1904 construction was resumed by Hispania who finished it in 1914. Even with medical advances more than 5,000 workers died and total cost was over 600,000,000 dollars.;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC190419148;Diseases, particulary malaria and yellow fever, were one of the primary difficulties during construction of the Mellom Canal. More than 22,000 were reported to have died during the Aenglisc construction attempt. In spite of medical advanves, more than 5,600 workers still died during the Hispanian construction years.;;;;;;;;;;;;x

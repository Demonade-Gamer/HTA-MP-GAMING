EVTNAME10225;Hungarian Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10225;The Hungarian nobility has grown increasingly nationalistic and liberal in recent years. The cities and countryside have become increasingly unruly, a violent and dangerous place for Bohemian officials and Czechs. In response, the Bohemian government ordered the Hungarian Diet dissolved and the replacement of the Governing Council with a single governor, Count Jirí Lukavský of Olomouc. The Hungarians have refused to obey, and thus we now face civil war to maintain the integrity of the realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC152009873;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ army forces in $CAPITAL$ have made their way toward the government buildings-- not to protect the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as is their duty, but instead to oust our leaders and install themselves as $COUNTRY$'s new rulers. They claim that $COUNTRY$ is in a state of 'upheaval', and only the army can restore order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC152009872;There is unrest among $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officers in the military, enough that some of them are actively spreading dissension among the ranks. $COUNTRY$ would be better served, they say, if the army was in charge rather than the current leadership-- elected it may be, but according to them it has proven too ineffective.

EVTDESC16050215;With their armies deafeated, their provinces occupied and their government retreating to Taiwan it has become clear that the Kuomintang no longer has the will to fight.  We may now claim dominance over China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC16050214;With our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Taiwan.

EVTDESC2037107;One of the other players has been cheating, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has a bonus he shouldn't have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1605020;After a period of self-enforced isolation, Hong Xiuquan has died-- some say of poison, others of illness. Regardless of the cause, the nation has been thrown into mourning for their beloved leader. Hong Xiuquan's son, Hong Tianguifu, is ready to step into his father's role as leader, but there are some who fear he will be unsuitable. They are advocating a restoration of the Qin dynasty. Others say that $COUNTRY$ must become a republic, in emulation of western powers. Whether $COUNTRY$ is ready for such a change is difficult to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTDESC1600010;It is as we feared-- the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has assumed control of lands in the south, and any attempts by the local governors to resume authority have failed. It is an embarassment to the prestige of the Imperial throne that we must deign to recognize that these rebels exist and must be dealt with once and for all. Some are even beginning to question the Mandate of Heaven if such a threat is possible. If we do not act, however, the rebels will surely gain control over not only the south but perhaps all of China.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316182;Qin officials recently boarded the Arrow, a ship that-- according to all reports-- was flying British colors at the time. The Chinese claim this isn't the case, and we've received news that they intend to crack down on the opium trade throughout the Empire. The British government is up in arms, saying that we must exert our influence over the Qin if we are to retain our position in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316181;Qin officials recently boarded the Arrow, a Chinese-owned ship (a lorcha) that was suspected of piracy and smuggling. Twelve Chinese crew members were arrested on suspicion of piracy by the Qin authorities. British officials have demanded the release of the sailors, however, claiming that because the ship had recently been British-registered, it was under their protection. The Imperial court has been enraged by this claim, suggesting that agreeing to British demands would give smugglers free reign throughout China.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316180;China has no need for, nor interest in, foreigners and their gifts no matter how ingenious they may be. It is only due to the emperor's generosity that foreigners are allowed to trade at all, and all such trade must take place at our will. The yi barbarians should tremble as they obey us and show no negligence! Barbarians shall bow down before the Chinese emperor in the manner customary for tributary envoys.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316176;Relations have been cool with $FROMCOUNTRY$, laced with bitterness over our nation's superiority. Lately the situation has reached a boiling point, and we have received a report that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ envoy to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ court has been ejected. Indeed, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals throughout $FROMCOUNTRY$ are reporting harassment and outright violence. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ are being refused berth at Chinese harbors. This is a systematic campaign by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ emperor to reduce our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316175;We have lost all patience with the barbarians who call themselves our 'masters'. They ignore our laws, our customs, and force themselves upon the generosity of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ throne at every opportunity. It is time we turned them out, refused them their free reign in our lands and ports, and demonstrated the true might of our Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316092;As we thought, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ infidels have forced a so-called 'treaty' upon us, demanding a great deal of reparations and land concession, in return for land they currently possess but have no more right to.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316091;We have won a great war against $FROMCOUNTRY$. Now we are faced with a dilemma: do we force the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government to the negotiating table, perhaps promising the return of some of their land in exchange for a treaty port and reparations? Or do we stay our current course and perhaps alarm the other great powers at our advances into $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ territory?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316090;We have won a great victory against $FROMCOUNTRY$. Now we must consider, do we negotiate with them, perhaps promising the return of some of their land in exchange for the island of Formosa and reparations? Or do we stay our current course and perhaps alarm the Western nations at our advances into $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ territory?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316089;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has won its war against us. Now their generals walk into $CAPITAL$, gloating with their superiority. It seems that, should they force us to the negotiating table to demand yet more concessions, we will have little choice but to comply.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316086;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership has signed our peace treaty, granting us Formosa as well as reparations.

EVTDESC1316085;The war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ is not going well. The damnable Japanese are in our lands and blockading our ports, and to the embarassment of our government there seems to be little we can do to stop them. $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have approached us to negotiate a 'fair' settlement-- hand over Formosa and pay reparations. While we could drag the war on and see if the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have the wherewithal to finish their assault, it might be in our best interest to give them what they want, though the loss to our prestige would be considerable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

EVTDESC1316081;A drunken riot by a large group of British sailors ashore at Kowloon has resulted in the death of a local man. By rights, the sailors should be tried and executed by the Qin magistrate. The British, however, have demanded extraterritoriality, meaning their citizens would be tried by British judges. This will inevitably lead to their release and the anger of our citizens, but demanding these mens' executions could lead to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010033;The revelation that Charles Stewart Parnell has been involved with a married woman, one Catherine O'Shea, and indeed is responsible for her subsequent divorce, was the scandal that ended his political career and prevented him from pushing the Home Rule agenda. Without him, it appears unlikely that the Irish Republican movement will gain the political clout it requires to attempt another passing of the Home Rule Bill.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010032;Charles Stewart Parnell has been successfully advancing his Home Rule Bill through Parliament, and while it is continually being held up by opposition from the Upper House, there is a sense that the man is managing to convince $COUNTRY_ADJ$ law-makers who, in the not-too-distant past, might have said that Home Rule was unthinkable./n/nNow we must consider whether his vision will see the light of day: do we grant Ireland the status of an autonomous Dominion under our control, or put this aside and face renewed violence among the Irish? Either way," this man Parnell will not desist, and the question will keep coming before us even if we do not pass the Bill now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010031;With Charles Stewart Parnell putting forward his Home Rule agenda, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens in $PROVINCENAME$ have become increasingly concerned that they might end up in an independent Irish state, one dominated by Irish catholics in Dublin. They have begun actively campaigning to ensure this doesn't happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010030;An Anglo-Irish politician by the name of Charles Stewart Parnell has just been elected to Parliament. Some are describing him as a firebrand and nationalist agitator, while others suggest he's a man of remarkable charisma and organizational talent, able to take on the entirety of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political system in order to push his Irish Home Rule agenda and succeed. It's very possible that this man could single-handedly turn the tide of opinion on the subject of Home Rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010025;With Ireland once again under our control, talks have begun in earnest to deal with the Irish situation once and for all... now on our terms, rather than on theirs. The suggestion is that Ireland remain an autonomous Dominion under our control, with any regions that wish to opt out of the new state and remain part of $COUNTRY$ able to do so. Others suggest this is unworkable, and we should either simply release them and keep them as allies or annex them entirely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010024;Spurred on by increased public sympathy towards the Irish Republican Brotherhood following the Easter Rising, the Sinn Féin have won a majority of seats in Ireland during the last election. They have gathered in Dublin and declared themselves Dáil Éireann, the parliament of Ireland, and demanded that Ireland be granted immediate full independence. Considering their popularity, refusing would all but certainly trigger a war... but many agree that this is not the way to a peaceful resolution, and that $COUNTRY$ should never submit to such demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010023;In an event organized by the Irish Republican Brotherhood, a group of Irish nationalists seized key locations in the city of $PROVINCENAME$ on Easter Monday, kicking off the most significant uprising in Ireland since the rebellion of 1798.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC1010021;We've received reports that the Irish Republican Brotherhood has been active in $PROVINCENAME$, spreading propaganda and generally stirring up agitation against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. The constabulary in $STATENAME$ has been actively hunting these nationalists down, but considering many within the constabulary are Irish themselves the process has not been simple.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010020;The tone among the people in our Irish territories has changed. Many Irish nationalist who emigrated to the United States founded a militant organization called the Fenian Brotherhood there, a group dedicated to freeing Ireland from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control... and now they have formed a sister organization back home, the Irish Republican Brotherhood. Already they are stirring up trouble, and it seems certain they will continue until some manner of home rule is attained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010016;Not content to wait until the dust of the war has settled, nationalists in Ireland have taken to the streets of $PROVINCENAME$ to call for the end of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. With our forces engaged elsewhere, their calls have quickly swept across all of $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010015;An aborted attempt at an uprising recently took place in the village of Ballingarry, Ireland. A group of Irish nationalists, frustrated by what they call the inept handling of the recent famine by the British government, engaged in a long gunfight with a unit of constabulary until reinforcements arrived and drove the men off. Many of these nationalists have since been captured and tried, but the event has sparked an increase in nationalism across the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010014;The blight affecting the Irish potato crop has spread to $STATENAME$. With the local harvest quickly failing, the effects are already being felt,in $PROVINCENAME$, the Irish are gathering in large crowds to receive aid sent by the British government. While they are grateful, times are still incredibly difficult and it's clear many are considering leaving Ireland to take their chances in the New World.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010013;The blight affecting the Irish potato crop has spread to $STATENAME$. With the local harvest quickly failing, the effects are already being felt, poor Irish peasants are walking the streets of $PROVINCENAME$, barely subsisting on the limited cornmeal handouts offered by the government, and many are obviously considering making their way to the New World out of desperation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010012;The blight affecting the Irish potato crop has spread to $STATENAME$. With the local harvest quickly failing, the effects are already being felt, poor Irish peasants are walking the streets of $PROVINCENAME$, begging for government aid which never arrives, and many are obviously considering making their way to the New World out of desperation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1010011;For years, British committees have looked into the situation in Ireland and predicted disaster: the Irish farmers had become more and more dependent on their potato crop, and if anything were to happen to that crop it would cause not only widespread chaos throughout the Irish economy but famine and worse. Their predictions have come true. A blight has been spreading, leading to failure after failure of the Irish potato harvest. Proponents of laissez faire economics are adamant that the market will provide food for those affected, and that the government should not interfere in private enterprise. Others claim that no expense is too high to help the Irish, and that failure to act quickly will lead to starvation and resentment... but conservatives are quick to dismiss this as inflammatory nonsense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999065;A recent incident involving the death of several slaves at the hands of their owner has gained national attention in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election, with both sides pouncing on the debate. Abolitionists say that this is but one more example of slavery being responsible for the inhumane treatment of one's fellow man. Proponents claim this is a matter for the courts to resolve, and accuse the Abolitionists of stirring up an isolated incident.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999061;While $COUNTRY$ is not currently at war, there are those who think it should be. 'They are ripe for the picking, and $COUNTRY$ must strike now! While we are strong!' They are referring to one of our hated neighbours, who some jingoists feel should be a target for expansion. Permitting such talk will make us look aggressive to the international community, however, though it may also be an opportunity of which to take advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999060;So far the war has dominated talk in the election, with a number of jingoistic politicians rousing the people with fiery speeches. 'We must protect $COUNTRY$!', they cry. '$COUNTRY$ must be mighty!' It seems they are being listened to, as so far they have enjoyed success throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999057;Immigration has long been a thorny issue in $COUNTRY$, with many citizens maintaining the opinion that allowing too many foreigners into the country leads to chaos and unemployment. $COUNTRY$ should be for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, and no others. Despite this, the plight of immigrants who are longing to be reunited with family currently located elsewhere has received a great deal of attention in the current election. There have been demonstrations by liberals in $CAPITAL$ calling for immigration reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999056;A demonstration by minorities in $CAPITAL$, denouncing the fact that 'universal suffrage' in $COUNTRY$ does not include them, has drawn attention throughout the country and sparked debates over whether minorities should be given the right to vote. Reactionaries are incensed at the idea, claiming that only 'true' $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens should decide its government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999055;A recent mine accident that led to the deaths of five children, all labourers working under the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ child labor laws, has led to a national debate over the issue. Children wearing protest signs have shown up at political debates, causing quite a stir and raising the question over whether the government should consider reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999050;Unemployment is still an important issue in $COUNTRY$, but all our recent attempts to crate new jobs have failed. During the election of $YEAR$, communists and fascists argued that their dogma is the only one that will give work to the people.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999049;The election is almost over, but liberals and socialists are still arguing about the current state of affairs. Unemployment is a problem, but both sides have decisive arguments for what they think has to be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999046;'Why does everyone stare at me when I make my vote? Do they really need to know? It is not like I am committing a crime or something, I simply want to vote in peace. Without having half of the polling station looking at me, that is.';;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999045;'Why are they allowed to change the rules during an election? Drawing random borders to scatter those who won't vote for them is not fair. It is fraud, I tell you! They divided our district between four others, because they knew how we would vote. FRAUD! That's what it is, I tell you!'\n\nThe issue of voter district gerrymandering has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999044;'They have beaten me, again and again. Why? Because I am a proud citizen who will speak the truth! I don't believe that the ruling party will save us.

EVTDESC999042;'Why is everyone trying to keep us out of politics? Because we are uneducated? They call us minors, but that is a lie! Our sweet and toil has brought the nation forward! We have waited long enough - now we demand our just due!' \n\nThe subject of voting rights for the poor has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999041;'...and mind you, we even pay way higher taxes then they do! Still, their votes are worth more than ours - I ask you: is that really fair?' \n\nWhile being allowed to vote, the middle class feels diminished by the current weighted voting rights, and the subject has been repeatedly raised in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC999040;'Why should only the rich be allowed to vote? We also pay taxes, so why shouldn't we have something to say in politics?' \n\nThe industrial revolution has empowered the middle class. More and more businessmen are making more and more money. It seems only natural that they demand voting rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999037;It looks like the conservatives have discovered a talent in the current election to find the right words when and where they are needed: All over $COUNTRY$ their agenda has persuaded a lot of people to join their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999036;There are a large number of people, particularly among the ruling elite of $COUNTRY$, who believe that liberal attitudes have been responsible for all of the country's ills. They advocate controls on immigration and a repeal of voting rights. They also appear to have charismatic speakers, for they seem to be gathering a lot of attention in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999035;A new breed of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ liberals has become very active in the current election-- educated liberals who believe equally in both social and political reform. They have been actively campaigning for people to support both, and have been attracting a lot of attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999034;It looks like the anarcho liberals, a group of radicals who have taken the liberal ideals to their extreme, have discovered a talent in the current election to find the right words when and where they are needed: All over $COUNTRY$ their new agenda has persuaded a lot of people to join their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC999022;The tensions from the current election campaign have escalated, with disorder spreading fast in $CAPITAL$ and spreading elsewhere. Advisors are recommending that the military be brought into the capital to restore order, though doing so will only contain the violence at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999021;The election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually violent. Only a few days after the campaign had begun, the first incidents started. Strikes occured in several large factories, with incidents of streetfighting in most major cities. Paramilitary groups have threatened voters of opposing ideologies, while radicals have staged attacks on political enemies. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police are tirelessly to get the situation under control, but it looks as if $COUNTRY$ is in for a contentious election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC999020;The remaining election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually quiet. The political parties have had no pressing issues which have gripped the country's attention,  and the election seems to be passing without any national debates or events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999010;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ political parties have begun a nationwide election campaign. So far, the effects have been quite limited, but in the end, one party will gain the upper hand. Advisors state that we could try to influence the outcome ourselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999004;Patriots and pacifists are fighting in the townhouse, using words to hurt and kill their enemies. A long since dead and buried dispute between $COUNTRY$ and its neighbor has once again shown its ugly head. Patriots wish to invade the country while pacifists believe that there are other ways to resolve the dispute.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999003;Two debaters are arguing heatedly about their views. The rest of the hall sits dumbfounded when words like aliens, minorities, ethnic and cultural groups are thrown between the two. One wish that immigrants should adapt to the dominant culture while the other believes that they should retain their cultural heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999002;'The morality and virtue of our people have started to decline!' This statement caused much stir among the debaters of toleration and religious plurality. They have started to question the country's view on religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999001;The debate had been going on for several hours, when a candidate stepped forward and presented arguments for their cause which silenced all opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999000;The intensive election campaign has reached the boiling point in $COUNTRY$, where a fierce trade policy debate pits the friends of free trade against the pals of protectionism in a rough rumble-and-tumble to determine the future of our nation's traders. Free-traders argue that goods must be allowed to freely cross all borders, while protectionists argue that our nation's fragile industries need protection from dangerous foreign competition threatening to undo them. Which path will $COUNTRY$ tread, as it decides on: Free trade, or Protectionism?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC900641;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us with a proposal: they will lend their support to us in the upcoming Congress, in exchange for Cyprus. The island's proximity to Suez makes it of strategic importance, after all, and while some might consider the offer an insult there are others who suggest that without this offer it's just as likely the island will be offered to Greece. $FROMCOUNTRY$ could ensure it isn't... and we could use all the allies in the Congress we can get.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC900640;An idea has arisen within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government: could we perhaps offer our support to the Ottomans in the upcoming Congress, in exchange for a lease on Cyprus?

The Ottomans could use all the support they can get, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880210;Investigation of the current party scandal by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ press has brought to light a number of interesting facts. It seems that abuse of power and influence goes well beyond what was initially revealed. Only the surface of this affair has been touched so far, and God only knows what might turn up within the next few weeks. No-one in $COUNTRY$ appears to be discussing anything else at the moment, and already there are calls in the press for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to step down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC880200;As more and more evidence against the ruling party has come to light, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has declared it has no choice but to resign and call an election.

EVTDESC131740;The leaders of the Kuomintang are preparing for their drive on Beijing, and $COUNTRY$ is expected to answer the call. Either we side with Nationalist China now, or we must abandon the Kuomintang cause and seek our own destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131736;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ general by the name of Feng Yuxiang has betrayed his superiors and broken off from the Beiyang armies. He and his supporters have taken the territory under their control and formed a new clique, swearing to topple the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131735;Now that we are free, we must choose where we stand in the ensuing struggle for the nation's destiny: either side with the Kuomintang and fight for domination of the republic or side with the Beiyang and fight for domination of a united China. Alternatively, we can declare our neutrality in the conflict and let the chips fall where they may.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131730;Resistance against the $CAPITAL$ government has culminated in a breakdown in authority. What began with several of the outlying warlords declaring their indepedence has ended with the most powerful generals in the Beiyang Army struggling for control. A contest has begun regarding who will control the future of China's destiny, and most are certain it will not be long before the entire nation is engulfed in war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131720;Warlord influence has begun to spread into $STATENAME$. These generals are still loyal to $COUNTRY$, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that they are taking control of a significant portion of the country. Officials in $CAPITAL$ are alarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131715;Our efforts to modernize the Beiyang army have borne fruit, but this has necessitated the division of authority among regional forces. The generals in charge of these forces, 'warlords' as some call them, have been gaining a great deal of power. They are part of the Beiyang Army, but fight amongst themselves... And, far worse, are critical of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. We will need to watch these generals carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC131709;An incident that began with drunken sailors murdering a Chinese man has escalated into a larger crisis with the Qin government. We have insisted that these sailors be tried by a British judge, the barbaric Chinese judicial system would result in these men getting anything but a fair trial. The chinese have demanded the men be turned over, and what's more that they be given the right to punish British citizens as needed. The confrontation has resulted in larger trade sanctions being applied against British merchants, and threats of worse. Our prestige as an Empire to be reckoned with is being threatened.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99016;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has submitted to the intervening powers, signing a treaty that promises to forcibly dismantle the Boxers and pay reparations for the atrocities committed in their name, and explicitly supported by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99015;We are forced to submit to the foreign demands, signing a treaty with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ generals and representatives from all the great powers. The Righteous Harmony Society will be forcibly disbanded, its leaders executed or imprisoned, and our government is once again humiliated.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99011;The Boxer situation in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has reached a head: the Chinese nationalists have entered Peking, laying siege to the Legation Quarter and putting the lives of dozes of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ merchants and dignitaries at risk. The Qin government has looked the other way, an act that is seen by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government as a declaration of war. Many are calling upon us to intervene in order to protect $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens from these barbarians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99010;The Boxers have reached the capital of $COUNTRY$, streaming into $CAPITAL$ to attack foreigners, and, far more noteworthy, they have laid siege to the Legation Quarter. Hundreds of foreign dignitaries and merchants reside within. If we do not step in to protect them, it will be seen as a declaration of support for the Boxers and an act of war against the great powers. If we do, the Boxers will see it as a betrayal of their cause and perhaps even rise up in rebellion against us. They have forced our hand now, however, and we have no choice but to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC99006;A group of Chinese nationalists known as the 'Boxers', intent on driving all western influence out of $FROMCOUNTRY$, have attacked a group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. Several were slain, while others were forced to flee for their lives. Worse, the Qin government has done nothing about it. They are looking the other way while these atrocities are being committed upon our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC99005;Throughout all of $STATENAME$, the Boxers are attacking western influence. Smugglers, missionaries, opium peddlers anyone they can apprehend is being slain or forced to flee for their lives.

EVTDESC99001;An attack upon a foreign merchant in $PROVINCENAME$ has signaled the arrival of the Boxer movement to $STATENAME$.

EVTDESC99000;'Support the Qin! Destroy the Foreign!'/n/nMany Chinese are growing enraged at the continuing encroachment of westerners into the Empire. They walk freely, spread Christianity with impunity, and ignore Imperial laws. A movement called the Righteous Harmony Society, known to foreigners as 'Boxers', has appeared, their mission to drive western influence out of the Qin Empire by any means necessary. Some are worried that attacks upon westerners could bring foreign anger down upon us, but there are those who see this as a good thing. Anger against westerners, even if it means a degree of chaos and disruption in our provinces, means support for the Qin government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

EVTDESC98640;The Ottoman monarchy has been overthrown, and now $COUNTRY$ stands in its place. The concept of Ottomanism, an Empire formed of diverse cultures and religions, has been set aside in favor of a nation built by and for the Turkish people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98636;Turkish liberals have grown increasingly defiant of the Ottoman monarchy, to the point where they suggest that the Sultan must be overthrown, replaced with a modern republic. They reject the notion of Ottomanism, saying it has already led to the Empire's decline, and that the way to restoring the nation's glory is to put the good of the Turkish people ahead of all other concerns... including religious.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98635;Spurred on by the continuing lack of reform, Ottoman liberals have radicalized into the 'Young Turks'.

EVTDESC98630;With the recent loss of European territories, nationalists within $COUNTRY$ have been inspired to rise up. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials are concerned we could be seeing a string of rebellions in the years to come, and already the army is scrambling to contain any efforts at rebel organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98626;The current state of unrest within the Empire has reached the point where the Sultan has been advised to abrogate the Ottoman Constitution. Absolute power must be returned to the monarchy in order to stamp out the militants, and while there are those who say that such action will only foster more unrest, there are others who are all too aware that failing to do so will make the Sultan look weak. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that reactionaries might seek to restore the monarchy by force, or, even worse, seek to abolish it altogether.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98625;A group of liberal intellectuals known as the 'Young Ottomans', led by the statesman reformer Midhat Pasha and influenced by the Liberal Revolutions elsewhere in Europe, have proposed a new constitution, the 'Kanûn-i Esâsî' or 'Basic Law', which would see an elected parliament created, would limit the powers of the Sultan, and speed up the Tanzimat Reforms. Conservative members of the Ottoman government claim that giving into these liberals will only speed up the erosion of long-held traditions, while others say that the reforms are sorely needed to stave off the decline of the Empire at the hands of nationalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98620;The Ottoman government had a number of policies regarding the treatment of Christians within the Empire which were considered oppressive: the capitulation tax, known as the Jizya, as well as controls over Christians which did not permit them to become soldiers or hold public office. It was not until the Hatt-i Humayun in 1856, also known as the Imperial Reform Edict, part of the Tanzimat Reforms, that things actually began to improve for minorities.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98612;Representatives from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, asking to set up an alliance with $COUNTRY$ should their demand for independence go unheeded. So far, they say, diplomatic efforts have proven fruitless... so $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assistance would be invaluable to them, and perhaps gain us a new ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC98611;Since $COUNTRY$ was denied its independence, there has been talk of open rebellion in the streets of $CAPITAL$. Fighting against our overlords might surely result in us being crushed, however.

EVTDESC98606;Not unexpectedly, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has denied our request for independence. It seems our only option is rebellion, as unrealistic as some claim that option to be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98605;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ arrived in $CAPITAL$ this month, presenting a formal request for their full independence from $COUNTRY$. They assure us that they fully intend to maintain ties with our nation, and have agreed to move forward as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ allies, but that they desire their freedom even so. There are many who feel such a request is beyond the pale and must be refused out of hand. Still others say that if $FROMCOUNTRY$ is denied, we could be facing a rebellion, and is it not better than to have a friendly ally than a recalcitrant and unwilling subject?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98600;There has been an increasing desire among the people of $COUNTRY$ to gain our full independence. Crowds gathering in $CAPITAL$ have demanded an end to rule by our distant overlords, and while many in the government are sympathetic with their cries there are also those who fear such a demand could lead to war.

EVTDESC98305;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election is underway, and so far has proceeded smoothly. Debates are being carried out in the usual manner, and there are no reports of violence in $CAPITAL$ or elsewhere. Supporters of the ruling regime have turned out in force, as have the hopefuls seeking to defeat the current government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98304;With the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election underway, supporters of the current regime have rallied in $CAPITAL$. They claim that stability is required to deal with the problems facing $COUNTRY$, and are actively trying to shout down opposition. Whether this will mean a victory in the current election is unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98303;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election gets underway, it becomes clear it will be a contentious one. The issues are clear and the battle lines between parties drawn, and there are those who believe that while violence may not be the result the toppling of the current $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regime could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98302;$COUNTRY$ has its share of problems-- and as the current election gets underway, there is a sense among many that the current government is to blame. Justified or not, that anger has instilled a sense that a regime change may be in the offing. Those who previously had never considered voting for any other party than the one in power are now considering doing just that.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98301;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, there is a general sense that things are not going to proceed smoothly. A sense of change is in the air, and while not everyone wants that change it seems there are many who have leapt upon the election as a chance to make it happen. A recent riot in $CAPITAL$ was only barely kept under control, and debates elsewhere in $COUNTRY$ are threatening to erupt into further violence as neither side is willing to budge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98300;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, the people are all too keenly aware that the nation exists in a state of war. Debates in $CAPITAL$ rage over the state of the war, though the overwhelming feeling is that now more than ever citizens should be supporting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. Still, there are some who believe that now is the perfect time for change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98261;Many Dutch settlers are pushing north of the Kaap Colony into areas only tenuously claimed by our government. We should consider increasing our presence in the region and establishing greater colonial government, before another country comes and claims it instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98260;Other European nations are eyeing the region of Namaqualand, directly to the north of our holdings in the Kaap Colony. To forestall their ambitions, it has been recommended that we establish an enclave at Walvis Bay and incorporate it into our southern colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98256;We have received reports from the Kaap Colony that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and the colonials. This time it has been caused by Xhosa and other natives who have gone cattle raiding because of the drought in the region. Many within the Kaap Colony are fed up with the constant conflict with the savages and believe it is time that the military moved in and took over their lands completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98255;Once again, conflict with the native Xhosa has flared into violence in our Kaap Colony. A band of Xhosa warriors spilled across the border, stealing cattle and burning down a host of Dutch farmsteads. Colonial citizens are demanding that the governor take action.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98250;The Zulus have slaughtered a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regiment that entered their territory without our authority. While we had not been seeking a war with the Zulus, now our hand is forced. We must either back down and apologize, or see this through to the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98249;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent negotiators to work out the terms of their surrender. The tone of the talks has been very bitter, and it's clear the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government will do all it can to return and trouble us again in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98248;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent negotiators to work out the terms of their surrender. The tone is one of reconciliation, and it is clear the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ wishes to build good relations with us after the business of this war is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98247;The Steenkoolers have proven far more resilient than we ever would have thought possible, and now we face the humiliating prospect of surrendering the Kaap Colony to them. It seems we have little choice, with the war going so badly and Kaapstad already occupied. All we can do is decide whether we will pursue a conciliatory path with the Steenkoolers and perhaps make them future allies or aim at returning in the future and reclaiming what has been lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98246;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have gone to war with the Obervahl, and many Steenkoolers are fearful that $COUNTRY$ will surely be next. They are crying out to our government to ally with the Obervahlis and stop the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from taking away their lands and their rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98245;Our colonial governor in South Africa declared an annexation of the Obervahl via special warrant several years ago, one that the Steenkoolers have stubbornly resisted. Both Obervahl and the Tusstrom have considerable resources which would be of value to $COUNTRY$, and we must consider the idea that keeping them out of the hands of competitors for African dominance is just as much reason to annex them as using those resources for our ourselves. The Steenkooler resistance has proven embarrasing. If we do not answer this with force, it will make the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ look weak to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98241;We have been approached by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats desperate for help in their war. Though they are loathe to do so, they are asking for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection. If we provide it, it does mean we establish an excellent claim over their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98240;The time has come to consider joining Stellaland. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98236;Gold has been discovered in the Olbers province, leading to claims from both the Obervahler and Tusstrommer governments that the region rightfully belongs to them. Mediation by the colonial government has led to Olbers being awarded to the griquas, who have subsequently consented to annexation by $COUNTRY$. This has led to considerable bad blood between the Steenkooler and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98235;Migrants have been moving in large numbers through our African colonies on their way to the newly incorporated town of 'Paulrugen', on the edge of the Wiessufer mountains, where a major gold rush is taking place. The massive influx of foreign residents to the area is causing trouble along our borders and friction between our governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98230;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonial authorities have met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to determine the requirements for our independence. They wish to see $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ remain strong, and would see us abandon any laws allowing slavery or the 'unethical' treatment of foreigners working in our territory ('uitlanders', as they are called). While our independence is a foregone conclusion, we must decide just how much we abide by their demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98225;With 'the Great Trek' underway, many of the Steenkoolers are eager to leave $PROVINCENAME$ behind and travel to either the Obervahl or the Tusstrom where they feel they will be free to pursue their own interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98221;We have endured the presence of the Steenkoolers, colonists who resent the Dutch and who have been trekking north to avoid their rule, for several decades now. We even thought it was possible to co-exist peacefully. After a number of skirmishes, all ending with our defeat at the hands of their firearms, they have taken over our land in the Obervahl and declared it their own. This is an outrage... yet what can we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98220;The Steenkoolers have been slowly trekking north from the Kaap Colony into areas normally claimed by the Ndebele. After a number of skirmishes with natives, they have come to dominate the Obervahl and established a new colony, one that is still technically under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ jurisdiction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC98215;The Steenkoolers have been slowly trekking north from the Kaap Colony into areas nominally claimed by the Basotho. After a number of skirmishes with the natives, they have come to dominate the Heeckeren River valley and established a new colony, one that is still technically under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ jurisdiction.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98213;We have received word from the Natalian government defying our annexation. Now we must either go to war or stand down in humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98212;After a series of altercations between Dutch colonial forces and the Steenkooler militia, we have received a demand from the Dutch government that Natalia be annexed into the Kaap Colony. For all our struggles to leave the Dutch behind, they yet follow us and refuse to allow us independence! So now we are faced with a choice: submit and move on, to find a place beyond their reach once more, or defy them and risk war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98211;After a series of altercations between Dutch colonial forces and the Steenkooler militia, the Dutch crown has decided to cut its losses and allow Natal its independence. Finally we will control our own destiny, away from the Dutch now and forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98210;The Steenkoolers of Natalia are once again chafing under Dutch rule, resenting the idea that even though they left the Kaap Colony they have not escaped the Dutch crown. There have been several altercations with Dutch military foces, and the recommendation of the colonial government is that Natal be annexed before the situation grows worse. If we do not, then we must allow the Steenkoolers to find their own way, and suffer the loss to our prestige this would entail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98207;The Steenkoolers which have trekked eastward into Zulu lands have reached a surprising settlement with the natives: they have staked out permanent borders for their new colony, and done so in relative peace. The real question remains whether we will allow this new Natalia Republic to stand. The Steenkoolers are Dutch subjects, after all, and their existence will no doubt draw more Steenkoolers to their side... perhaps providing a threat to our African ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98206;The Steenkooler encroachment into Zulu lands has provoked a reaction: the Battle of Blood River, prompted by the massacre of Johann Averbeck and his fellow pioneers after they attempted to negotiate borders for the new Natal settlement. The Vorausers won a decisive victory at the battle, and have now carved out a new colony, with the only question remaining whether the Dutch will recognize their independence or continue to treat them as subjects of the crown. Either way, further conflict seems certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98205;The Steenkoolers are eager to get away from Dutch rule, slowly leaving the lands of the Kaap Colony and heading both east and north into the African wilds. The ones heading east are encroaching on Zulu territory, however, and it seems there is no end to them. They possess firearms, but we have the superior manpower... and all our chiefs agree on one thing: if we do not do something about the Steenkoolers now, they will dominate our territory and turn the Zulu people into colonial subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98200;The Steenkoolers are descendants of German Frisian settlers in the eastern Kaap Colony, and they have in recent years begun to chafe under Dutch rule. More and more of them are leaving their farmsteads and moving to the east and the northeast, encroaching on territory traditionally ruled by the Xhosa and the Basotho. Conflict with those native peoples appears to be inevitable, as perhaps is conflict with the Steenkoolers themselves, should we allow any lands they claim to remain independent. As far as the Dutch government is concerned, the Steenkoolers are Dutch subjects, no matter where they go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98105;Cuban sugar mill owner Carlos Manuel de Céspedes has issued the 'Grito de Yara', the 'Cry of Yara', declaring Cuban independence from $COUNTRY$ and freedom for his slaves. The man has many followers, and his call has spread rapidly throughout the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98100;The treatment of slaves in Cuba has become increasingly harsh after recent unrest, culminating in the so-called 'Ladder Conspiracy' which relates to a method of torture involving tying a slave to a ladder and whipping them until they confess or die. Reformists in the colony have been calling for a change in Spanish policy and an end to the slave trade there. Failure to do so could result in more uprisings, but bowing to such pressure could have serious repercussions back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98008;A group of Czech radical democrats attempted to overthrow the government in a coup. They were unsuccessful, but their actions have inspired their countrymen to rise up in demand of freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98007;There has been general discontent among the Hungarians, and a group of young revolutionaries have appeared to demand a number of concessions including freedom of the press.

EVTDESC97700;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots have risen up in $FROMCOUNTRY$, and have gained control of the capital. They send word they wish to bring all our lost provinces back to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control. Agreeing would mean risking war, but refusing would mean angering our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97681;The warmongers in the Japanese government are now demanding that Russia cede Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands entirely to them. To give up so much territory without a fight would make us look very weak, but Japan's might has grown tremendously in recent decades. Can we risk a war in the Pacific?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97680;Japan has quarreled with Russia before over the rule of Sakhalin Island. Now, our influence in China and Korea has led to renewed friction between our nations. The Line of Advantage dictates that we must extend our control over the whole of Sakhalin and establish a stronger northern border. But are we willing to risk war with a European power?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97679;After the recent murders of a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ sailors off the coast of Formosa, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has delivered a demand: turn over the island, for the sake of their security, or it shall be war between $FROMCOUNTRY$ and $COUNTRY$. We know this is just an excuse for their militarist expansion... but can we stand up against their might?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97678;The recent murder of Japanese sailors off the coast of Formosa has given rise to a question within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government: should we use this excuse to step in and wrest control of the southern island? The Line of Advantage is clear, dictating that the land would be invaluable to our goals. But are we willing to risk such a war?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97677;Our nation's policy of the Line of Advantage dictates that we must expand our borders if we are to maintain security. Naturally, our most vulnerable point lies in neighbouring Korea. They must either be brought under our direct control or made into a vassal if $COUNTRY$ is to be kept safe. Already $COUNTRY_ADJ$ generals are clamoring for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97676;Believing $COUNTRY$ to be weak, the hated Japanese have decided to strike at us and take control of our government. They shall find us a difficult target!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97675;The Chinese have fallen into warring factions, all but crumbling their power and leaving us an advantage we would be fools not to exploit. The Line of Advantage policy dictates that we should strike, and strike soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97674;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has followed a policy of progress and westernization until now, hoping that advancing $COUNTRY$ to match the Western powers would keep us safe. We now see this is in error, and that only by an aggressive expansion of our borders can we hope to maintain the security of $COUNTRY$ proper.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97673;$COUNTRY$ has followed a militaristic path until now, determined to set ourselves against our neighbours in the interest of security-- while risking that security with dangerous wars. The new $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has determined that this must change. We must follow a path of progress, and instead devote outselves to technology and westernization if we are to remain free and whole.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC97666;Saigo Takamori is dead, some say he committed seppuku after receiving a wound, and the rebellion he inspired is now ended. To many, this was the last gasp of the ancient samurai and a new way for $COUNTRY$ on the path of progress now lies ahead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97665;A growing dissatisfaction among the former samurai with the abolition of the han system and the resulting reduction in their personal prestige has crystallized in a rebellion. Led by one of the most prestigious samurai leaders of the former Satsuma Domain, Saigo Takamori, the rebellion has attracted a large number of followers and will be a severe challenge for the Japanese government to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97660;With the ascension of Emperor Taisho, whose poor health has prompted a shift in political power from Japan's old guard to the Imperial Diet, democratic parties are beginning to see their influence spread throughout the country. Though democratic tradition is not deeply rooted, the idea of enfranchisement as a right of the individual Japanese citizen has become far more broadly accepted. Students, university professors and journalists inspired by Western schools of thought have organized public demonstrations to demand new reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97652;The Tokugawa shogunate has once again asserted control over Japan. A bakufu messenger has arrived at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ palace in $CAPITAL$ to demand our submission to direct rule from Edo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC97648;While Kyoto has long been the capital of Japan, and home to the Imperial Court, the city of Edo has become the de facto capital-- for centuries it has been the center of shogunate power, as well as a cultural and administrative center.

EVTDESC97637;There is a growing restlessness among the daimyo, with some whispering that the Tokugawa shogunate has grown weak and is unable to deal with the encroachment of foreign powers. We have received word that the shogunate has consulted with the fudai daimyo, perhaps seeking new allies.

Approaching one means angering the other, of course, but it appears we have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC97630;There are some who believe that Emperor Komei was assassinated-- delivered a handkerchief laced with smallpox, perhaps by radicals who fear the possibility of compromise between the bakufu and the imperial court.

EVTDESC97627;The shogun's Chief Minister has been assassinated by ronin samurai outside the very gates of Edo castle! Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point, yet the shogunate refuses to compromise with the imperial court.

EVTDESC97624;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Iemochi as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada. This was always the preferred choice of the fudai daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the outsider tozama will have their influence in the bakufu kept to a minimum.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97623;Pandering once again to the fudai daimyo, all relatives and close allies within the bakufu, the child Iemochi has been appointed shogun-- instead of the more sensible candidate chosen by the tozama.

Perhaps the time has come for the Emperor to rule Japan, a single leader to bring the nation into this new era?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97622;Even though the fudai daimyo, the relatives and close allies of the Tokugawa clan, supported the appointment of young Iemochi as the new shogun following Iesada's death, instead the leader of the bakufu will be Yoshinobu... a candidate favored by the outsider tozama daimyo. The fudai are growing increasingly alarmed at the insidious influence of the tozama, and there is a stirring sentiment that perhaps the time has come for a grander change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97621;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Yoshinobu as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada.

EVTDESC97620;Tokugawa Iesada, the 13th shogun of Japan, has died childless. This has begun a struggle within the bakufu to select a replacement. The southern tozama daimyo wish to see Tokugawa Yoshinobu become shogun, while the fudai daimyo and shogunate officials are more in favor of Tokugawa Iemochi-- even though he is still but a child. It seems certain that, no matter which candidate is victorious, the disaffected daimyo will see this as a loss of power and make trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

The incident has affected the Tokugawa shogunate's relations with foreign powers, as well as incited locals into riot.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97615;'Revere the emperor and expel the barbarians!'\n\nThis is the slogan chanted by neo-confucian activists, reacting to the Tokugawa shogunate's opening of Japan to foreigners. There have been growing reports of violence all over the country, primarily against foreign visitors and statesmen but also against the shogunate itself. Each incident chips away at Tokugawa control over the daimyo and erodes relations with the western powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97610;Despite the overwhelming odds against them, the Japanese have refused our generous offer of surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97609;We have formally concluded a treaty with the Japanese which will see our influence restored, and our demands for their ports to be opened to our ships to be met. Additionally, an indemnity will be placed upon their government to make up for the expense of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ war effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97608;We are being overwhelmed by the superior might of western armaments. Despite the loss of face, we must consider offering the hated foreigners terms of our surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97607;Commodore Perry has returned from his mission to Japan with unfortunate news: they have chosen to defy his ultimatum and thumb their collective noses at our government. Should we back down now, it will be a great blow to our prestige and our influence in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97606;Commodore Perry has returned from his mission to Japan with a treaty in hand: we have gained numerous trade concessions, but more importantly we have cracked open the shield that is Japan's policy of isolation. This is a great coup for American diplomacy and influence in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97605;More 'black ships' have appeared off our shores, these ones commanded by an American named Commodore Matthew Perry. The ill-tempered westerner is demanding an end to the Japanese policy of Sokoku-- specifically trading rights in several ports, extraterritoriality for American sailors and protection for their shipwrecks. At first he demanded to negotiate with the Emperor, but that is impossible. Thus it falls to the Shogun to either agree to his demands, risking the appearance of weakness, or refuse and bring the wrath of the Americans upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC97601;Meaning 'Western Learning', Rangaku referred to the body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave at Dejima. Despite the enforced isolation of the nation, this policy of learning allowed western influences to spread-- particularly in the southern domains of Satsuma and Choshu.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97600;Meaning 'locked country', Sakoku was the foreign relations policy of Japan instituted by the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, with no foreigner allowed to enter the country on pain of death. While some contact with westerners was permitted in the south, at the Dejima trade enclave in particular, such contact was strictly regulated and kept Japan in a state of isolation from the rest of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC97571;We have received reports from the Kaap Colony that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and the colonials. This time it is evidently caused by natives returning from the diamond mines, attempting to take back control of their lands without any consideration for due process. Many within the Kaap Colony believe it is time that the military moved in and took over their lands completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97570;Now that $COUNTRY$ is free, native $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens are beginning to protest against the colonial regime that still remains. Foreigners still hold the highest positions in the government, and have a privileged status in comparison to those they once ruled over as a colony. In $PROVINCENAME$, the recent arrest of a native for trespassing on the estate of a foreigner has led to riots, and dissension has spread throughout all of $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97566;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is besieged by rebels, and threatens to fall if they do not receive assistance from $COUNTRY$. They warn us that if the rebels are successful, it's very likely that $FROMCOUNTRY$ would cease to be in $COUNTRY$'s sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97562;$CAPITAL$ has been taken by the enemy, and a great deal of $COUNTRY$ is lost to our control. Many are saying that we only continue the war because our foreign masters insist that we do so, and that the time has come for us to let go of these ties-- no matter the consequences. Perhaps they are right, though it seems the situation is dire for $COUNTRY$'s future no matter what we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97561;With our forces off valiantly facing the enemy, rebels have taken advantage of the situation and stormed $CAPITAL$. They have taken over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and already done a great deal of damage in order to drive out foreign influence in $COUNTRY$. Without the forces to oppose them, there is little we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97560;The Federal Republic of Central America is rapidly disintegrating. Members of the government have met in $CAPITAL$ to discuss whether the union should be officially dissolved and the state of Guatemala declared, or whether we should fight to preserve what we have. Some consider that to be an impossible task, though liberals argue that we should not allow conservatives doom the region to a future of division and internal squabbling.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97556;The government has managed to restore order in the Costa Rica region. Officials in San Jose have re-dedicated themselves to the future of the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97555;The government has managed to restore order in the Nicaragua region. Officials in Managua have re-dedicated themselves to the future of the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC97553;The government has managed to restore order in the El Salvador region. Officials in San Salvador have re-dedicated themselves to the future of the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97552;With rebels in Honduras having already declared its independence from the Federal Republic, it has become next to impossible for the government to maintain order in Nicaragua. Government authorities have withdrawn as locals have overtaken the capital in Managua.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97551;With rebels in Nicaragua having already declared its independence from the Federal Republic, it has become next to impossible for the government to maintain order in southern Costa Rica. Government authorities have withdrawn as locals have overtaken the capital in San Jose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97550;The Federal Republic of Central America has been chaotic since its inception. Liberals who had high hopes for the union are in constant battle with conservatives, in particular the clergy and wealthy landowners, and there is a general fear of domination by Guatemala. At this point, the struggle to maintain the union seems like an almost impossible one.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97526;The Volaseans have foolishly declared them independence. We must take action at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97525;The cursed Volaseans have coaxed the Russians into declaring war on us in support of their independence. We cannot let this stand!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97518;We have received word from the Russian government: they have refused to support our claim of independence in exchange for Izmail. We are on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97517;We have received word from the Russian government: they have agreed to support our claim of independence in exchange for Izmail.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97516;The Volaseans have approached us with a deal: in exchange for our assistance in their war of independence against the Turks, they will return our lands in southern Bessarabia. It is a way to regain our influence in the region, though it does come with a steep price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97515;To this day we remain a subject of the Turks. A growing movement has demanded our indpendence, and there are those who believe an offer of alliance with the Russians along with a guarantee of returning their lands in southern Bessarabia might entice them to support our efforts. Still others fear what a war of independence with the Turks will do to our nation. Is it worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97512;As we suspected, the terms of Russia's treaty are punishing indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97510;The powers of Europe have met in Paris to settle the recent matter of the Crimean War. One of the provisions set out is that the newly-united Volaseans would receive the Budjak in southern Bessarabia (also known as Izmail). Refusing would put us at odds with the rest of Europe and perhaps lead to further war. Accepting might repair some of our relations with Volasea, but would definitely be a blow to our prestige and our interests in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us, begging for terms of surrender. It will mean relinquishing our current wargoals and sitting down with them to work out the terms of a treaty once the war is done, but we are confident they will be to $COUNTRY$'s benefit. No doubt the other powers of Europe will be far less pleased, but that is not our concern. Such a treaty will prevent this war from continuing on interminably.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97507;Russia has control over $CAPITAL$, and much of our nation is either overrun or in complete chaos. We cannot continue. Our only option may be to surrender to the Russians and negotiate a treaty, in which we will doubtless be forced to hand over many concessions. Failure to do so, or should the Russians refuse our offer, could mean the war continuing for a very long time yet, and $COUNTRY$'s utter ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97506;In what is perhaps a foolish move, the French have pressure the Turks into accepting their sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine... authority which has traditionally rested with the Russians since the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The question simply remains whether we should interfere. While holy sites are not our concern, trade routes through the Levant lead to India... and a Russian war with the Turks could directly threaten our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97505;Through a combination of military and political pressure, we now have no choice but to accept French claims in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed that the French and the Roman Catholic Church should be the supreme Christian authority in the Holy Land, and have turned over control of Christian holy places, including the keys to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. This is in contravention to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ treaty with Russia, and will no doubt lead to conflict, but is at the same time a boon to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97503;The French have successfully pressured $FROMCOUNTRY$ into accepting their claim of authority over Christian holy sites in Palestine, authority which has traditionally belonged to us ever since the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. This is a breach of the treaty and a threat to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97502;The French are not willing to abandon their claims to the Holy Land. There have been several demonstrations of naval force along our coast, and these have been combined with offers of protection against Russian retaliation. If we agree, we have a friend in France but almost certainly war with the Russians. If we refuse, very likely we will have a war with France on our hands. Which would we prefer?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97501;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused our demand, stating that the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca grants Russia authority over Eastern Christians and not France. More than likely they simply fear what the Russians will do. A show of force combined with the enticement of a protective alliance might compel them, though that will certainly cause friction with the Russians and there are some who say we should discontinue this venture now while we still have the chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97500;The French ambassador has arrived with the following demand: they wish the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to recognize them as the sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine, turning control over all Christian sites to the French. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca signed with Russia in 1774 states that they are the sole protector of Eastern Christians, and should we agree to the French demands it will almost surely lead to conflict with the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97181;We have lost control of the situation in $STATENAME$. The rebels have gained sufficient control that they have ejected the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governors and declared their independence... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97180;Rebels in a neighboring colony have destabilized it enough that the people there are calling out for $COUNTRY$ to restore order. This is our land, and it seems that the western powers have all but abandoned it to chaos. So why shouldn't we intervene? Still, there are some who say this will only damage our relationship with a power... one we cannot afford to anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97175;The rebellion in $STATENAME$ has been going on for far too long, and we are in danger of losing control of the colony entirely. Local militants in $PROVINCENAME$ have gone so far as to declare their nation's independence... and while that isn't yet true, as $STATENAME$'s state of chaos is still far too widespread, it's an embarassment to $COUNTRY$ and,  given enough time, the militants might gain enough control to earn the colony's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97171;Followers of the Mahdi have struck again, this time in the province of $PROVINCENAME$. The religious leader's jihad against foreigners has sparked a local rebellion, one that the authorities have had a difficult time putting down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97170;A Sudanese religious leader by the name of Muhammad Ahmad has proclaimed himself the Mahdi (or 'guided one') and begun a war to unify the tribes in western and central Sudan. While the local government in Khartoum initially dismissed this man, further reports indicate the Mahdi possesses a great deal of magnetism, and his rallying call of driving all foreign presence out of the Sudan has gained him a large following. These Mahdists may prove to be a serious threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97166;The Monroe Doctrine dictates that the United States is responsible for protecting the western hemisphere from encroachment from imperialists in Europe , such as what Spain is doing right now in South America. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has put the Monroe Doctrine to the test and appealed to us for aid, asking for an alliance in case Spain should decide to expand its influence even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97165;The United States claims it intends to protect the New World from encroachment from imperial powers in Europe. Now that Spain has made its imperialist intentions evident, perhaps it is time we put the so-called Monroe Doctrine to the test?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97161;An envoy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has issued a protest to our involvement in South America, telling us in no uncertain terms that we are not welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97160;Spanish imperialism has raised its head once again, with the Spanish throne having gone to war with a neighbour in an effort to restore their lost influence. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are rightfully worried at what this means, and there are calls for us to take a stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97156;An envoy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has arrived with the expected news: they have agreed to submit themselves to Spanish rule once again, if we so choose. Some might wonder if it's worthwhile for Spain to involve itself in South American affairs, particularly since they will ultimately try to rebel out from under us. Perhaps we have proven our point?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97155;We have been overrun by Spain, and now have no choice but to surrender our sovereignty to our former colonial overlords. It is a bitter day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97153;A Spanish deputy by the name of Eusebio de Salazar y Mazaredo has arrived to negotiate with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government regarding the Talambó incident. The problem, however, is that he carries with him the title of Royal Commissary. This is a title reserved for officials dealing with Spanish colonies, not ambassadors to sovereign nations. This is a deliberate insult to $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97152;News has arrived in $CAPITAL$ regarding an incident in $FROMCOUNTRY$. According to reports, a fight broke out between two Spanish nationals and a much larger group of locals. One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who subsequently demanded the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. Predictably, they have refused. This is a direct challenge to Spanish authority from a former colony. If we do not react in kind, we will lose a great deal of credibility. Perhaps now is the time to reassert our authority over $FROMCOUNTRY$? Cutting them down to size may force them to submit to our rule as a vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC96150;We have proven that no nation can stand in $COUNTRY$'s way. We will do as we please, and no amount of objection from the so-called great powers of the world will deter us from achieving our destiny. For now there is peace, and if other nations seek to stop us from achieving our future goals, they are welcome to try.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC96141;We have received a cable from $FROMCOUNTRY$: they have declared war upon us, and will pursue the war until such a time as $COUNTRY$ is disarmed and submitted to the will of the international community.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTDESC96136;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have approached our nation with an ultimatum: dimantle $COUNTRY$ immediately, or the great powers of the world will be forced to unite against us. Their demands consist of the following:\n\n1. The return of all unlawfully-held territories gained by conquest.\n2. The release of any aspirant peoples currently within our lands.\n3. The transfer of all colonies and overseas territories to the other great powers.\n4. An agreement by $COUNTRY$ not to declare war on any other nation for a period of no less than ten years.\n\nIt goes without saying that these demands are extremely humiliating, and the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people would be justifiably upset should we agree. If we do not, however, $COUNTRY$ will face a great war which even we may not be able to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96131;The world's great powers have taken note of $COUNTRY$'s efforts to change our aggressive ways. Some are making overtures to improve relations, and their diplomats are expressing hope that $COUNTRY$ will continue to deal with other countries in a civilized manner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTDESC96130;There are rumblings in the international community regarding $COUNTRY$'s warlike demeanor, and some are talking about the need for a united front to contain $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aggression. There are even efforts to stir up our own citizens against us. We will have to be careful in the future, lest we face not a single enemy but that of the world's great powers united against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

EVTDESC96110;Abdul-Aziz, scion of the House of Saud, has returned from exile in Kuwait. Not only that, the man has managed to forge an alliance with the southern Bedouin tribes and retaken Riyadh. We must deal with ibn Saud quickly, lest he retake even more land and reverse our earlier victory over his house.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC96106;We have received word of an uprising that has occurred in $PROVINCENAME$. A group of Mashriqi tribesman attacked the local $COUNTRY_ADJ$ garrison, and were quickly put down. The $PROVINCENAME$ governor made a point of displaying their bodies, hoping that would discourage others from following suit. It hasn't. Arab outrage has been fanned throughout $STATENAME$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC96105;The general insurgency by $COUNTRY$'s Arab population has been brought to an end. For the moment, peace has been restored and the momentum of the Arab resistance dissolved.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC96102;The Arab Revolt has begun, and many people in $CAPITAL$ are flying the revolt flag. They are demanding freedom from foreigner rule, and we will have difficulty keeping them under control... provided that's what we wish to do, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC96101;We have been granted self-rule by our $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ rulers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC96100;A wave of nationalism has begun to spread among the Mashriqi, fueled by their resentment over $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Our governors in the region are understandably nervous, and report that we can expect major rebellions in the coming years unless we are very careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC96090;With the loss of $COUNTRY$ in the recent war, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy has received much of the blame, there have already been several assassination attempts, and calls within the government for the monarchy to step down. Sentiment in the public has turned to the notion of $COUNTRY$ becoming a democracy... though some fear this will plunge the nation into even further chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC96087;As the armies of our former enemy leave $CAPITAL$, they leave behind a newly-installed communist government friendly to their nation. How long this government will last is unknown, but many within $COUNTRY$ seem already determined to overthrow it in the name of freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTDESC96086;As the armies of our former enemy leave $CAPITAL$, they leave behind a newly-installed fascist government friendly to their nation. How long this government will last is unknown, but many within $COUNTRY$ seem already determined to overthrow it in the name of freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTDESC96085;As the armies of our former enemy depart $CAPITAL$, they leave behind a newly-installed democratic government friendly to their nation. How long this government will last is unknown, but many within $COUNTRY$ question whether 'freedom' imposed by a foreign power is truly that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTDESC96081;An isolated $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ territory has been offered to us. We should consider whether we wish to adminster it, as accessing the land may be difficult according to current borders. But, then again, do we truly wish $FROMCOUNTRY$ to keep it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC96071;Negotiations are still underway as to which countries will obtain control over the remaining $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ colonies and overseas territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC96070;According to the peace treaty, our colonies and overseas territories must be surrendered. Negotiations are currently underway as to which nations they will be 'assigned' to. It appears our humiliation is not yet complete.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTDESC96066;The assassination of a prominent $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizen by a dissident has, after a thorough investigation, turned out to be at the instigation of an enemy power. This is but the latest in a string of incidents designed to destabilize $COUNTRY$. The results of the investigation have leaked to the public, and massive crowds gathered in the streets of $CAPITAL$ are now calling for total war.;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC96065;A diplomatic incident with one of our enemies has outraged $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens. Several weeks ago, an envoy assigned to $CAPITAL$ was accused of stealing national secrets. It turned out the truth was far worse, and an investigation has unearthed a conspiracy to destablize $COUNTRY$ and leave it week for invasion. This has leaked out to the public, and now crowds in the capital are calling for total war.;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC96031;We have received word from $FROMCOUNTRY$ that they have agreed to an alliance. Whether or not they will actually live up to that alliance and join us in the war remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC96030;A diplomat from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached us with a proposal: an alliance with them, to fight in a war against their enemy... who is certainly no friend of ours. While the alliance does not necessarily obligate us, the question really remains whether or not $COUNTRY$ even wishes to go to war. If we fight with $FROMCOUNTRY$, we stand the chance of gaining the spoils of war for ourselves. It also means we could fall with them. The choice is ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC96025;Now that we are in a state of total war, the idea has arisen that $COUNTRY$ should approach $FROMCOUNTRY$'s enemies to see if there are those who would join our side against them. This may mean an unholy alliance with those who might never fight at our side otherwise, but as the old saying goes: 'The enemy of my enemy is my friend.' If we are to win the war against $FROMCOUNTRY$, we may have to take that to heart.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC96022;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has been created from the ether, but the powers-that-be have determined at least some of their lands rightfully belong to $COUNTRY$ and should be returned to us. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have rejoiced at this news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTDESC96020;With the war finished, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have taken to the streets of $CAPITAL$ in celebration. The toll of the war has been heavy, but today $COUNTRY$ is simply happy to be at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTDESC96017;One of the matters discussed at the treaty talks is what to do with $FROMCOUNTRY$'s colonial holdings. We are not a great power, and it's possible that even if pursue some of their colonies for our own we'll end up with nothing... but if we do not try, we'll end up with nothing for sure. Even so, making the attempt could be seen as aggressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC96016;One of the matters discussed at the treaty talks is what to do with $FROMCOUNTRY$'s colonial holdings. They should not be allowed to keep these lands, but determinining how they should be disposed of is no simple matter. For now, agreement has been reached determining some of the territory, and any remaining will have to be negotiated over in the coming year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC96015;The defeat of $FROMCOUNTRY$ in their war has forced them to the negotiating table, and one of the terms for the breakup of their empire is our release from their direct rule. This would mean casting out $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ officials and potentially turning them into an enemy. We could maintain our close ties with $FROMCOUNTRY$ even with our freedom, though this would mean passing up a chance for freedom and goodwill from $FROMCOUNTRY$'s enemies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTDESC96014;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has been forced to concede defeat in its war, and now treaty talks have begun to discuss the breakup of their empire. As an enemy of $FROMCOUNTRY$, our place at the table is assured. At the very least, any $COUNTRY_ADJ$ lands currently in $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ possession should be returned.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC96013;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has been forced to concede defeat in its war, and we have been invited to the negotiating table to discuss the potential breakup of their empire. This could potentially mean we see $COUNTRY_ADJ$ lands returned to us, though if we forego our claims it could mean salvaging a relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTDESC96010;We have lost the war, and like vultures the victors have descended upon us. We have been forced to the bargaining table to accept humiliating terms regarding the breakup of our empire, with many of our lands simply given away, and we shall be permitted no overseas holdings whatsoever. This is a moment that shall be remembered in $COUNTRY$ for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTDESC96006;The war effort is not going well, to put it lightly. Advisors are saying that $COUNTRY$ should sue for peace, do whatever it takes to end this war before something even more terrible happens. The people are on the brink of revolt. We must act!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTDESC96005;Growing demonstrations in $CAPITAL$ demonstrate the prevailing attitude of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people: get us out of the war, and soon. Too many have been lost, too many sacrifices made, and all for what? The people wish to go back to their regular lives, without the constant spectre of war hanging over their heads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC96004;The constant state of war $COUNTRY$ is under has taken its toll on our people. Shortages of basic goods and the failure to deliver swift victory have worn down the enthusiasm with which the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people initially greeted the war effort. If things don't turn around soon, we could face growing weariness and unrest within our own borders.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTDESC96000;$COUNTRY$ is in a state of total war with one of the Great Powers of the world. In a modern age where warfare has the capability of killing millions, the very future of our nation could be at stake. The call has gone out to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people: put aside your petty differences," your day-to-day lives and your personal ambitions. $COUNTRY$ must pull together in this, our hour of need!;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,
EVTDESC95655;We are in a difficult situation. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces cannot hold out against the French onslaught, and they plague us at every opportunity. Perhaps we must face the realities of the situation, and sit with the French at the negotiation table to give them what they want. If we fail to do so, $COUNTRY$ is surely lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95652;French diplomats have arrived in $CAPITAL$ with a set of demands: namely that we should surrender control of all eastern territories not 'rightfully ours'. This includes all land claimed by Laotian, Khmer and Vietnamese minorities. It is an outrageous demand, of course. How dare the French claim to be 'protectors' of these people! Yet do we dare risk war with the Europeans?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95650;Many in our government believe we should press our influence in Indochina, expanding our colony there to include some of our less civilized neighbours. Perhaps the time is right for war?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95647;Cambodia has been under Vietnamese control since our war with Siam. Now it seems the Cambodia king has approached the French and asked for protection, and the French have agreed to offer it. They are demanding control over Cambodia, on threat of war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95646;King Norodom of Cambodia has sent our government a request: he asks that the French intervene in his nation, demanding it be released from Vietnamese control and made our protectorate. This would suit our goals in Indochina, though it risks war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95645;We have an issue before us. The Vietnamese rule over our kingdom, and it seems certain that, very soon, either they or the Thai will demand we submit in full and are swallowed whole. The French stand on our borders, eyeing Indochina with their own ambitions. Perhaps they will make kinder rulers? Rebellion seems almost certain to end with Cambodia being torn to pieces by both.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95641;First they send their 'missionaries' into our country, flouting our laws and offending our people with their spouted nonsense. They turn our own citizens away from the righteous path, and expect us to do nothing? $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have seized upon this excuse to demand all of Cochinchina in recompense.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95640;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In $FROMCOUNTRY$, the execution of several missionaries in the Cochinchina region has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention. So far, discussion has gone nowhere and the idea has now arisen that forming a protectorate in the area may be our only solution.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95639;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in $COUNTRY$ for many years now, or perhaps we should say they are attempting to, as they have encountered considerable resistance among the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. Recently, in the southern region of Cochinchina, one of the local aristocrats took offense to the intrusion of several missionaries and executed them-- without our leave. Word of the deed has reached the attention of the French government, meaning their eye will almost certainly turn to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

EVTDESC95616;Unrest within $FROMCOUNTRY$ against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule has reached a boiling point, and it appears the only solution is to step in and rule them directly. Should we fail to do so, we may find $FROMCOUNTRY$ soon taken from our control and turned into a target for a foreign power's expansion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95614;It seems that $FROMCOUNTRY$ is content to accept the incident was not our intent and turn its attentions elsewhere. For the moment, $COUNTRY$ is safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95613;Thanks to the Great Game and its maneuvering, tensions with $FROMCOUNTRY$ have been rising. Recently, an incident occurred near their border where several $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers were attacked by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers. There were several deaths, and while the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is apologetic there are those within $COUNTRY$ who are calling for us to move in and assume control of their government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95612;The Great Game between the British Empire and Russia has one pushing ever northward and the other pushing ever southward, with $COUNTRY$ caught in-between. Recently, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers got into a skirmish with one of our neighbours... and the resulting incident has brought the infernal gaze of one of these powers upon us, perhaps meaning war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95611;Advisors to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the British will continue their northward expansion. If we do not press south, Russia will soon have its southern borders exposed to European invasion. It does us no good to allow the British complete hegemony over Central Asia. Something must be done!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95610;Advisors to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are warning that the Russians will continue their southward expansion. If we do not press north from India, we will soon find the Russians on our doorstep... And, at that point, it will be a quick step for them to invade the British Raj directly. Steps must be taken to set up puppet governments between us and them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95599;We are the original inhabitants of this land, and we have managed to survive and even prosper despite the aggression of our alien neighbours. We do not share their values or their mores, and we do not want them to invade our earth, in war or in peace. We do not allow outsiders to immigrate to our land, nor do they want to come. Instead, we ensure good stewardship of the land and raise many sons to defend our home. We will show the rest of the world our strength and our resolve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC95515;Now that Imperial rule has been restored, we must endeavour to spread control over lands that neighbour our own but which are rightfully part of our Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95512;The 'Age of Princes' is upon us. The rulers of Ethiopia must struggle to unite the land under a single Emperor, and now it is $COUNTRY$'s time to act.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95510;With the Sudan in chaos, the Ethiopians have taken advantage of the situation to regain control over the Eritrean coastlands. Though we may yet regain control over the Sudan, we should consider whether the Eritreans must be punished for this trespass.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95509;The Red Sea port of Assab has been sold to $FROMCOUNTRY$ by the local Afar sultan. They have begun to use the port as a coaling station, and fears within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government are that they will use this base to expand their influence within $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95508;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ shipping company has come into the ownership of the Red Sea port of Assab, sold to them by a local Afar sultan. The port would make for an excellent coaling station, and perhaps even provide a base for $COUNTRY$ to expand our influence in the area. Pushing for more direct control, however, could cause tensions with Assab's owner-- who might feel they have greater right to the port than the sultan.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC95507;A disturbing report has reached us of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ nationals being expelled from $FROMCOUNTRY$. Indeed, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has systematically eliminated our influence-- meaning we are in a position where we must either accept the humiliation of being thrown out of an uncivilized country or step in and assert our authority. There are some who say this is a golden opportunity to establish a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ protectorate, while others say $FROMCOUNTRY$ is simply not worth the trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95506;Our presence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ has reached the point where $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence is felt in every level of their society. They are a protectorate in all but name, and the time has come for us to determine whether that status should be made official. Shall we agree to make $FROMCOUNTRY$ a protectorate and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ colony, or support their independence as a friendly ally?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95505;European presence in $COUNTRY$ is felt everywhere. Their traders come to $CAPITAL$ and dictate to our own merchants how trade will commence. They take what they want and pay what they wish. They tell our government what laws we may pass, and even when they do not we must always consider how they will react to what we do. If $COUNTRY$ does not act now, they will turn our nation into a colony under our very noses-- but perhaps that has already happened, and we must resign ourselves to their protection.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

What they also bring is death, and we must always be wary what lies behind their smiles.'\n\n$COUNTRY$ stands on good terms with much of the western world, but our leaders are all too aware how quickly that could change. The Europeans believe we are not civilized, and the tone of our contact with them is slowly changing from friendly interest in trade to a strange paternalism coupled with cultural superiority. For now, $COUNTRY$ survives... but we must watch for the moment when the civilized nations decide our enslavement is the only way we can be 'saved'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95502;Word has reached $COUNTRY$ of a great meeting of colonial powers in Europe, wherein it was decided that African nations would be divided up amongst them-- as if our people were little more than children's toys discarded and left waiting to be picked up. This has caused a great deal of concern among those of our people with the knowledge to understand what this means. For others it has brought little more than resentment, as well as vows to fight for our independence when the day comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95501;A conference has been held in $FROMCOUNTRY$, attended by all colonial powers, to discuss the regulation of colonization and trade in Africa.

EVTDESC95251;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ East India Company has been slowly spreading its influence within the East Indies, and is urging our government to establish protectorates over the remaining sultanates on the islands.

EVTDESC95250;Brunei's control over the southern regions has only ever been nominal, and the region has been self-governed under the Sultan of Sarawak. During a recent crisis, an Aenglisc man by the name of Osulf Etwell provided the Sultan invaluable assistance in restoring order, and has been bestowed with the title of governor. This 'White Rajah' is now effectively the ruler, and is seeking alliance with Brunei.

It seems the uprising has been in the planning for some time, and if the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government intends to remain in control of Cuba it could have a battle ahead of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90094;Egypt has fallen, settling matters with the Turks through a peace treaty which has seen the Levant taken from them and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in Egypt vastly reduced. We can let the matter lie, or fight for both our stake in Egypt and our honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90093;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have sent a demand through diplomatic channels that we back down from our support of the Egyptians. Doing so will harm the influence we have gained in Egypt, but if we do nothing we risk retaliation from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90092;We have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire. If we do not object now, that support could lead to their intervention in the war. That objection, however, could also be seen as aggression on our part and harm our relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90091;We have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire. If something isn't done it could develop into an alliance between Egypt and $FROMCOUNTRY$ that could lead to their intervention in the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90090;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Egyptian diplomats have contacted ours through channels, and suggested that support in its war would be appreciated and rewarded. The Ottomans, they rightfully point out, are after all no friends of $COUNTRY$. Such an act could earn us the enmity of the Empire and its allies, however, and thus feel we must remain neutral in the conflict despite the possible benefit to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90089;The Egyptians have surrendered to $FROMCOUNTRY$ and agreed to abide by the terms of the London Convention. Stability has been restored to the Orient... for now. All that remains is for us to decide whether to end hostilities with the Egyptians and return any $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ lands that we hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90088;The Egyptians have raised the white flag, offering to abide by the Convention of London and return both Crete and the majority of the Levant to our control. Our advisors say that wresting control of the entire country is almost impossible, and that we should take the offer while we can and let the Egyptians go.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90087;Our forces are on the run. It seems the hated Ottomans and their allies have won the day, and we have little choice but to submit to their demands. We can try to hold out and turn the tide, but it is far more likely that Egypt will simply be carved up into pieces by the imperialists if we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90086;We have received word through the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ embassy pledging their support for the Ottoman Empire in our conflict with the Egyptians. This is heartening news.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90085;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Should the Egyptians successfully challenge Ottoman rule, it could upset the entire balance of power in the region... something that many feel would threaten $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests. Still others believe that $COUNTRY$ must remain neutral, despite the cost to our relations with the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90084;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has declared that it will not accept Egyptian surrender, and has rejected terms that the rest of Europe feels are quite fair, instead pushing onwards to recapture all of Egypt. There are many within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government who feel this is a betrayal... $COUNTRY$ intervened to help maintain $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from collapsing, but perhaps they do not need our help at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90083;Still stinging from their defeat at the hands of the Ottomans, the Egyptian aristocracy has focused the blame on the rapid westernization of the nation and the instability they claim it has brought. They are demanding that the government cling more strongly to tradition and repeal some of these reforms, and there are fears that if they are not satisified they may instigate a revolt.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90082;An uprising in $PROVINCENAME$ has gained popularity throughout the region, spreading the unrest throughout all of $STATENAME$. Local authorities have moved swiftly in an attempt to keep the violence contained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90081;We have brought Egypt to its knees and restored Ottoman rule to the area. Now we must decide whether to be gracious and allow them to retain autonomy, while restricting their land and power, or whether to rule all of Egypt directly and face the possibility of rebellions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90080;The Turks have proven unable to retake the Levant from us, despite all the assistance they have received from the rest of Europe. Even those great powers must now admit that the Levant rightfully belongs to us, and that the 'Sick Man of Europe' has no claim over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90079;Despite our willingness to negotiate, Egypt has refused to accept any Ottoman influence in their territory... and also refuses to give up control over any of the Levant. We have no choice but to take it from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90078;Our negotiations have been successful: Egypt has agreed to partition the Levant, and we retain influence within their territory. While this spares us a great deal of bloodshed (and the possibility of an embarassing defeat), it does mean we have lost control over the Christian Holy Land in Palestine, something that will not go over well with the powers of the world, and with Russia in particular.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90077;While we expected immediate Ottoman reprisal, it seems our former overlords are willing to negotiate. Their proposal is as follows: split the Levant between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, allow Ottoman influence to remain and they will permit our independence. Of course, while this would retain an alliance with the Empire it seems like many to hardly be true independence at all. Still, it would avoid a great deal of bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90076;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now that independence has become all too apparent, and Ottoman mastery over the Orient is threatened. Either we must take steps to rectify the situation, and assert our dominance once and for all, or admit to the world that our power is little more than an illusion. There are those who feel that a peaceful solution is possible, and that the Egyptians might better serve as powerful allies than as implacable enemies, but that would require us to surrender our claim to Egyptian lands as well as be an affront to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90075;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now it has become all too apparent, and a threat to the vision of the Ottoman Empire as master of the Orient... something which has been little more than an illusion, but which the Ottomans must either address or have it shattered forever. War will come, and Egypt will either be beaten back into place and made to heel at its master's side or seek its own destiny as a power in its own right. Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC90068;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with disheartening news: despite considerable dissension among those attending, a consesus was reached that creating stability in the Balkans is more important that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests and sovereignty. The demands are humiliating, and will see us losing much of the Balkans if we agree. If we defy the Congress, however, we could be facing war from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90067;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with mixed news: though the consensus reached was that $COUNTRY$ needed to be kept strong, they still placed numerous demands upon us that would see the political map of the Balkans rearranged. If we choose to defy the European edict, we could be facing wars from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90066;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans, with delegates from the Ottoman Empire also in attendance. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that creating stability in the region was best even if it came at the expense of the Empire's power. The Russian delegates were pleased, but Ottoman delegates left in a rage. It remains to be seen whether they will bow before the Congress's demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90065;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that the Ottoman Empire needed to be kept strong, and any demands placed on it should not weaken its interests unduly. Few of the attendees were pleased, the Russians in particular, and even though the Congress favored the Ottomans it remains to be seen whether they will bow to European pressure and uphold the Congress's edict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90064;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel we should favor keeping the Ottoman Empire strong, in the interest of preventing the Russians from expanding into the Middle East. This could potentially improve our relations with the Ottomans, as well. Others believe stability in the Balkans should be the priority, even though this might come at the expense of the Ottomans and our relationship with them. Still others feel we should not take part in this veiled attempt at dismembering a sovereign nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90063;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans.

We shall see what manner of 'negotiation' $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90062;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of $COUNTRY$ to maintain stability in the Balkans.

We shall see what manner of 'negotiation' $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90061;Now that plans for the conference in $CAPITAL$ are underway, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ statesmen are busy trying to determine what our stance on the issue should be. Some feel we should favor keeping the Ottoman Empire strong, in the interest of preventing the Russians from expanding into the Middle East. This could potentially improve our relations with the Ottomans, as well. Others believe stability in the Balkans should be the priority, even though this might come at the expense of the Ottomans and our relationship with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90060;The Ottoman Empire has been in slow decline for much of the last century, but never has this been more apparent than in recent years. The Empire's hold on the Balkans is weakening, and this threatens to upset the entire balance of power in Eastern Europe as Russia and other countries will inevitably be drawn into the conflict. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government feel that it falls on us to call the powers of Europe together and negotiate a settlement that will restore some semblance of stability to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90057;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has brought Schleswig-Holstein under German control, finally resolving its status within the confederation. It's possible that aligning ourselves with $FROMCOUNTRY$ is far more in our best interest, as well as more likely to create a united Germany under North German dominance. We should reconsider our current allegiances.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90056;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has brought Schleswig-Holstein under German control, finally resolving its status within the confederation. This puts it in a unique position to assume leadership of the German Confederation as well as dominance over the North German states. We will need to take swift and decisive action if $COUNTRY$ is to maintain its position of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90055;The question of Schleswig-Holstein's place within the German Confederation has now finally been resolved, in our favor. This will have larger repercussions, as the free German states will see that $COUNTRY$ is the true leader of the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90054;The arrogant German aristocrats in Holstein have declared they intend to pursue a future with the German Confederation to the south, and consider Schleswig an indivisible part of their territory. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ militants are angrily calling for the military to step in, though some fear this may lead to war with the Germans.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90053;King Frederick VII has died and left no heir. According to the recently-drafted constitution, the crowns of both Denmark and Schleswig would pass to Duke Christian of Glücksburg. The crown of Holstein is more problematic, however. The House of Augustenburg claims the crowns of both Schleswig and Holstein and is calling on German support. If the new consitution is signed, Schleswig-Holstein will be officially divided. If it is not, the Danish people will almost certainly rise up against their new king.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90052;Now that order has been restored to Schleswig-Holstein, international pressure is mounting to uphold treaties regarding the region. Failure to restore nominal independence to the duchies and keep them united will result in tensions between $COUNTRY$ and other European powers, and possibly war with the German Confederation to the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90051;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ crown wishes to annex the Duchy of Schleswig, which has long been considered indivisible from the Duchy of Holstein. The German aristocracy is enraged by this move. They believe their future lies with the German Confederation to the south, but the Duke of Augustenberg has a stronger claim to Schleswig than the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ King. Schleswig-Holstein must forge its own path, even if it means war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90050;The duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have long been united and considered indivisible under the Danish crown, but a question of royal claim to the duchies combined with the Holsteinian desire to join in the larger German Confederation to the south has led to considerable difficulty for King Frederick VII. The treatment of Danish people in Schleswig living under Holsteinian domination has led to a call for the duchy to be incorporated into $COUNTRY$ proper. This is unlikely to be looked on favorably by the conservative German aristocracy in Holstein.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90041;Polish peasants in Austrian-held Galicia have risen up and slaughtered wealthy landowners, leading to calls by nobility within the Free City of Krakow for a larger uprising.

EVTDESC90040;A mutiny by a group of sepoys in the service of the British East India company has ignited lingering resentment amongst our Indian subjects into open resistance against our rule.

EVTDESC90038;We have been approached by a Sardinian envoy, the Count of Cavour, who has made an interesting proposal: an alliance to make war against Austria, gaining Sardinia the Austrian-held provinces of Lombardy. In exchange, Sardinia would hand over Savoy and Nice to France. It is an interesting idea, and one that allows France to take a role that would not paint us as the aggressors. Shall we agree?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC85030;The rebellion in Korea has grown worse, and already we have reports of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ consulate under assault by rebel forces. It seems the Korean government is helpless. Considering that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ stands by doing nothing, refusing Korean appeals for help, it seems we are in a position to act-- some are suggesting that we engineer a pro-Japanese coup in Seoul to install a government more firmly in our control, and prevent any possibility of an overthrow eliminating our influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC85029;Reacting to the Tonghak uprising, the Chinese have moved forces into Korea, entering $CAPITAL$ and effectively setting up a government under their complete control in a swift coup. That there has been no reaction from the Japanese government is surprising, just as it is frustrating that our embattled armies have had no chance to agree to this so-called 'help' from the Chinese. Either way, rebels and loyalists alike are enraged at this foreign intrusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85028;Responding to news of our intended intervention, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered Seoul and captured the Korean Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react. A pro-Japanese government has been installed, effectively rendering Korea a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ vassal, with orders to end any agreements and alliances with $COUNTRY$ and ban our forces from entering their nation. This is, of course, an insult of the highest magnitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC85027;Reacting to reports that the Chinese are planning to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ forces today entered $CAPITAL$ and captured the Imperial Palace in a swift coup before our own armies could react.

Both rebels and loyalist forces throughout the country have reacted in rage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85026;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has moved to intervene in the Tonghak Rebellion currently underway in Korea. It seems likely that, should $FROMCOUNTRY$ succeed in quelling the rebellion, they will become the unquestioned masters of Korea and all but eliminate what influence we possess there. The only sensible move is to send in forces to overthrow the Korean government and replace it with one that is more firmly pro-Japanese-- despite the conflict this will all but certainly spark with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85025;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has received reports of a massive rebellion forming in Korea, serious enough that several members of the Korean government have sent an urgent call to $COUNTRY$ to intervene. Any forces we dispatch will likely provoke a response from Japan, who will fear that we are attempting to uproot their influence. This may, however, be an opportunity for $COUNTRY$ to solidify our own influence in Korea-- many advisors are saying that we cannot allow the potential response from Japan stop us from acting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC85021;The unrest caused by the Tonghak movement appears to be coming to an end. The militant leaders have vanished into the countryside, and their followers have dispersed. Order is restored, for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC85002;One of our rulers has executed a group of French missionaries, resulting in French outrage and a punitive expedition against $COUNTRY$, which should have brought our Qin allies to our defense. Frustratingly, and perhaps not unexpectedly, the Qin have responded by severing their ties to $COUNTRY$ and abandoning us to our fate. War with the French seems likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85001;The foolish Koreans have begun executing Catholics within their territory, and this has included a number of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ missionaries, and now the French have demanded retribution. The problem, naturally, is that Korea is a Qin tributary. We are obligated to come to the Korean's defense, even if this means war with $FROMCOUNTRY$. Of course, there are those who say the Koreans have brought this on themselves. We would lose little sleep if we left them to their own devices, and earn favor with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC85000;There has been increasing violence against French missionaries in Korea, recently culminating in the execution of Bishop Siméon-François Berneux, head of the fledgling Korean Catholic Church, and the subsequent killing of almost all priests in the country as well as thousands of Catholic Koreans. One surviving priest fled to the Qin Empire, relaying his tale to a French war vessal which then launched a punitive expedition with the support of the French consul in Beijing. There is a call for France to go to war against Korea, but this is complicated by the fact that Korea is a tributary state of the Qin. If we press the matter, we risk war with the Koreans' master, but if we back down it will be a great blow to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This kind of approach was pioneered by some small extremist political organisations and soon was copied by more mainstream groups even governments. \n Groups ask for funds and terrorist cells start to appear as nations begin applying this new kind of power projection. A new era of revolutions dawns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC60168;Ethnic and religious tensions have long plagued the Old World. But the preeminent countries of the world are not ready to upset the balance of power in favor of the rights of the downtrodden at this time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC60160;Today crowds gathered in $CAPITAL$ to celebrate $COUNTRY$'s independence. In the modern world, independence can be a fleeting thing, so we must enjoy it while we can. Today, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags wave from every window and corner, and jubilant citizens sing the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ anthem. It is a heartfelt theme that speaks of better tomorrows.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC60140;With the new government firmly in control of our country, they feel that now is the time for a constitutional convention. Everyone's views, well at least everyone who truly matters, will be represented in this new gathering to shape the path of our nation.;Alors que les libéraux tiennent les rênes de notre pays, ils estiment le moment venu pour une convention constitutionnelle. Les vues de chacun, du moins de tous ceux qui importent vraiment, seront représentées dans cette nouvelle assemblée afin de forger la voie de nos nations.;Die Liberalen haben unser Land fest im Griff, und sie glauben, dass es jetzt an der Zeit für eine konstitutionelle Verfassung ist. In dieser neuen Verfassung, die den zukünftigen Weg unserer Nation eben wird, werden die Meinungen aller repräsentiert sein, zumindest jener, auf deren Meinung es wirklich ankommt.;;Los liberales, con un firme control sobre el país, creen que ha llegado el momento de organizar una convención constitucional. Todo el mundo (al menos todo el mundo que cuenta) estará representado en esta gran asamblea que dará forma al futuro de nuestro país.;;;;;;;;x  ;,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49510;Our subjects in Finland have become restless, and resistance against attempts of Russification have been growing.

EVTDESC49509;As our power in Scandinavia wanes and $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence grows, so does the focus of the union move to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC49506;This time they are not asking nicely. Independence or war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49505;Your Norwegian subjects seek to establish their own independent kingdom. The other European powers support their independence, and will be upset if we refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has suggested a political union between their country and $COUNTRY$, arguing that this is the next logical step for Scandinavia's security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49503;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has proposed the next logical step in our mutual cooperation: a customs union between $COUNTRY$ and $FROMCOUNTRY$, indeed all of Scandinavia, which would remove the restrictions on trade between us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49502;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ proposal. It is now in our hands whether to let the Union die here and now, or force $FROMCOUNTRY$  to join us whether they like it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49501;Members of the $FROMCOUNTRY$ government have approached us, suggesting that the Kalmar Union must be ressurrected. For the moment, this is simply an idea, a suggestion that the Scandinavian nations should work together towards an eventual union. If we disagree, it's possible that the idea dies here. If we don't, $FROMCOUNTRY$ might be mortally insulted. If Scandinavians are to take their rightful place in Europe, however, perhaps there is merit in their proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTDESC46612;The rebellion in Entre Rios has been put down, and both General Urquiza and his liberal supporters have been captured and executed. The Argentine states have submitted to the will of Buenos Aires.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC46611;With Rosas unable to defeat the Entre Rios rebellion, he has been forced to flee Argentina and General Urquiza has assumed temporary control of the government. Meeting with liberals in Santa Fe, they have drawn up a new constitution which has created an Argentine Republic. The Buenos Aires province is displeased and vows to resist,but the wind of change is clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC46610;General Justo José de Urquiza, the governor of Entre Rios, has turned against the Rosas government and demanded that it submit to liberal demands for a new constitution. There are hints that neighboring governments might support Urquiza, and that should he rise up in rebellion against us they will intervene on his behalf.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC46605;Unrest is stirring against the Rosas dictatorship in Argentina, with liberals demanding a constitution and a trasition to democratic rule.

EVTDESC46304;The dictator of Paraguay, Solano Lopez, has turned his eye towards Brazilian lands to the southeast. Direct access to the Atlantic Ocean would be of great benefit to the country, rather than relying on Uruguayan permission to use the river, permission which might not always be forthcoming, thanks to Brazilian interference. Perhaps it is time to flex Paraguay's muscle and establish an empire of our own?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC46303;Porto Alegre is under Brazilian control once again. The gauchos, however, have promised to continue their rebellion against what they consider unfair rule from the throne. It may prove difficult in the coming years to keep the region calm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC45102;Juan Pablo Duarte has founded a secret society called 'La Trinitaria', seeking complete independence of Santo Domingo from Haiti and other foreign powers. Many Caribenos are calling the man a visionary, and his ideas are gaining great popularity in eastern Hispaniola.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44846;A diplomat has arrived in Washington from Texas, a part of the Mexican frontier, settled by southerners who had been offered land by the Mexican government and who then rebelled against its tyranny. The diplomat has asked for American intervention in their war, claiming that a treaty had been worked out with Mexico which they then of course immediately refuted. It seems like shaky grounds but do we turn our backs on them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44845;Despite the assurances supposedly offered by the Treaties of Velasco, we once again find ourselves at war with Mexico. The ceasefire is, it seems, now over. While many in our government never expected Mexico to live up to the terms of the treaties anyhow, they do suggest that this might be enough cause for the Americans to intervene. Such an intervention would, of course, be inviting the wolves through the front door but do we have any other choice?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44843;As expected, the Mexican government has refuted the Treaties of Velasco and refused to negotiate for Santa Anna's return. They are, however, evidently afraid that the treaties have enough validity that ignoring them would give the Americans an excuse to intervene, and have called for a ceasefire. How long it will last is unknown, but for the moment Texas has its respite.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44842;While Mexico had every reason to refute the treaties signed by Santa Anna, it seems their willingness to continue the war against Texas has waned. They will not embarass themselves further, and have agreed to let us remain free in exchange for Santa Anna's return. For the moment, this means the war with Mexico is over... whether that peace will continue remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44841;In a humiliating blow to Mexico's prestige, General Santa Anna has been captured within Texan territory, separated from our army and found wandering the countryside in an attempt to return to Mexico. While imprisoned, he agreed to a series of treaties which recognized Texan independence among other guarantees... all in exchange for his safe return. We are now faced with a question: while the treaties are worthless, disregarding them completely could give the Americans a cause to intervene. Either way, one thing is certain: as the architect of this fiasco, Santa Anna's time in power is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44840;In a surprise development, the leader of Mexico, General Antonio de Santa Anna himself, has been captured. Found running through the countryside, attempting to escape back to Mexico, he has been imprisoned in a Texan jail and forced to negotiate. We can force the man to agree to a peace treaty, even though many consider the odds of Santa Anna's own country agreeing to terms exacted under duress to be slight, it may be our only hope against overwhelming odds. At the very least, the humiliation dealt against their leader will be a blow against the Mexican government and one from which they will not soon recover.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44835;Porfirio Díaz, General of Mexico and considered a hero by some, has overthrown the democratic government of Mexico in a military coup. Planned in secret with several military officers and announced in Oaxaca, it has disavowed the presidency of Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada and installed Diaz as a military-backed dictator.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44830;Emperor Maximilian has never enjoyed popular support in Mexico, and now that insurgents led by Benito Juárez have captured him it seems his reign has come to an end. Court-martialed and executed by a firing squad, the new republic was declared only days after his death. Benito Juárez has assumed the role of President of Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44827;Despite having them over the figurative barrel, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused to capitulate to our demands. So much the worse for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44826;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, ceding all American-claimed territory to our control. For now, the relations between our two countries can return to normal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44825;With our capital under American control, it seems we have little choice but to negotiate. The Americans have offered us a deal: the normalization of relations, the forgiveness of our debt and the payment of a great deal of money... all in exchange for a cession of all the northern territories currently claimed by their country. If we refuse, it may mean many years more of war for us until these Americans get what they want.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44822;Eventually, the Mexican government will come after our country and seek to re-incorporate it into the federation. If we are to survive, joining the United Provinces of Central America may be our only hope. Shall we make the request?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44821;Angered by the abrogation of the 1824 Constitution and the centralization of government power in Mexico City, liberals in the Yucatan have declared their independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44820;Inspired by the success of the Tejas rebellion, liberal malcontents in the provinces along the Rio Grande have risen up and declared their independence from Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44815;The rebel state of Tejas has been recaptured. A glorious victory for Mexico, and a blow against the malcontents who seek to spread dissension and discord!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44810;Malcontents in $STATENAME$ have risen up in defiance of the government, demanding a return to democratic rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44808;Not unexpectedly, Mexico has ignored the terms of the Treaties of Velasco, claiming that Santa Anna only agreed to them under duress. Indeed, Santa Anna himself has been quick to back up their claim even despite his precarious position. The one bright light in this? It might be the cause the American government has been looking for to intervene in our war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44805;A general and war hero of Mexican independence, Santa Anna was elected President in 1833. After deposing his liberal vice-president, Santa Anna abrogated the 1826 Constitution and took control of the country as a conservative dictator with both church and military backing. Many Mexican states objected to this centralization of power, and with the rebellion of Tejas to the north the entire country seems to be in a state of chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44357;After a massive effort expended to create a pass through the Rocky Mountains, the Canadian National Railway has been completed! A single railway now links the Pacific coast to the Atlantic. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to celebrate the first locomotive being sent to make the complete journey!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44356;The second stage of the Canadian National Railway, linking Calgary to the Atlantic Coast, has been completed. Now work must begin on the last stage, which will be the longest and most difficult yet as it requires creating a pass through the Rocky Mountains themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44355;The first stage of the Canadian National Railway, linking Winnipeg to the Atlantic Coast, has been completed. Now work must begin on the second stage, which will be considerably more difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44351;Representatives from British Columbia have met with Canadian delegates in $CAPITAL$ to discuss terms of their joining confederation. The only thing that appears to interest them is the building of a national railway linking the Pacific and the Atlantic. Without it, they say, the nation is too divided and they are more connected with other regions along the Pacific coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44339;The land north of the 60th parallel is inhospitable to settlers, but there is a growing concern that should the Canadian government not move to fully claim the territory another power will do so. It will take considerable political capital to convince the other world powers of Canadian dominion in the north, but many feel we must make the effort... and considering there are reports of gold in the Yukon it might be wise to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44325;Relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$ are friendly, and thus the dream of a larger Canadian confederation has resurfaced. Delegates from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have made the journey to $CAPITAL$ with the goal of negotiating terms of joining our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44322;A British act which would have seen us offered the rights to purchase all of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company has been defeated. Canadian dreams of uniting the continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific have been dashed in one fell swoop! Citizens in $CAPITAL$ are outraged at this betrayal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44321;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has passed an act which would see the Canadian government offered control over all of Rupert's Land, essentially all $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ territory in North America east of British Columbia. We would need to purchase the land from the Hudson's Bay Company at no small expense, though it would be one of the largest land purchases in history.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44320;A bill has been passing through the British Parliament which would see the entirety of Rupert's Land, all North American colonial territory between British Columbia and Ontario, being given offered to the Canadian dominion. Currently the land is administered by the Hudson's Bay Company, and thus the Canadian government would be required to purchase it. Should they choose to do so, it would strengthen our ally greatly and relieve our overextended colonial holdings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44318;The colonial government of British Columbia has officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance. This will see the colony better able to protect itself without military support, and considering their united stance it's entirely possible that should we refuse we will see rebellion there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44317;The colonial governments of the Maritimes have officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance. This will see the colonies better able to protect themselves without military support, and considering their united stance it's entirely possible that should we refuse we will see rebellion there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44316;The colonial government of Quebec has officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance.

EVTDESC44310;A gathering of governors from our Maritime colonies in North America has also been attended by governors from Canada. According to reports, they are attempting to organize a larger confederation of the colonies with an eye towards eventual self-government. We would like to see the North American colonies be more self-reliant, so it may be in our best interest to allow this union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44306;Lord Durham has returned from his mission to investigate the causes of the rebellion in Upper and Lower Canada with recommendations to the British crown, namely that the two colonies be united under a single responsible government through an Act of Union. He fears that, if we do not, we may be facing further rebellion just as was faced in America. Indeed, it is entirely possible the Canadian radicals could attract support from the Americans if they are not appeased.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44305;Perhaps inspired by the American Revolution, colonists in both the Lower Canada and Upper Canada colonies have risen up in rebellion. They are frustrated by the lack of political reform, as well as the entrenched power held by the reactionary elites of the 'Family Compact', and agitators are demanding responsible government if not outright independence. The colonial government has moved to arrest the perpetrators as traitors to the crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44303;It has taken time to settle the grievances following the Riel Rebellion, but treaties with the various Metis groups throughout the North-West territories have managed to properly incorporate them into Canada.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44155;The British have elected to withdraw from Oregon and have signed a treaty to hand any American land over to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44154;As American and British settlers begin to move to the west coast of North America, there has been a growing dispute as to who owns the Columbia District. The entire region west of the Rockies (called the Oregon Country by the Americans) has been explored by both countries and there are legitimate claims on either side. Recently the situation has been exacerbated by American politicians rattling their sabres over their idea of 'Manifest Destiny', and they have pressed their claim all the way north to the 54th Parallel. It will almost certainly mean war, and our only consideration should probably be whether we wish to pursue another costly war with the Americans in North America when our time could better be spent elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44153;The talks with the British have broken down, primarily due to the continuing calls by war-mongering politicians. Neither of our options now is very pleasant: either we abandon our claims to Oregon no matter what some might think, or we press ahead with the claims and brace for eventual war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44152;The British have agreed to a compromise, splitting the Oregon Country between us at the 49th Parallel. Any British lands held by us will be turned over to them, and vice-versa. Though some Americans are upset, many others are breathing a sigh of relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44151;As American and British settlers begin to move to the west coast of North America, there has been a growing dispute as to who owns the Columbia District. The entire region west of the Rockies (called the Oregon Country by the Americans) has been explored by both countries and there are legitimate claims on either side. The British claim all the way south to the 42nd Parallel and the Americans north to the 54th Parallel. The situation is tense, and made more so by jingoistic American politicians calling for sovereignty over the entire continent. Even so, the American government has sent a delegation seeking a compromise in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC44147;The Hawaiian Islands are ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44146;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to sell the Hawaiian Islands territory. Considering the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people already consider the territory rightfully ours, many are calling for war to reclaim the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44145;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to inquire about the possibility of purchasing our Pacific Island territories near Hawaii.

EVTDESC44127;The Mexicans have refused our generous offer. Our only recourse is force of arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44126;The American ambassador has informed us that it would be in our best interests to sell the lands north of the Rio Grande to the United States. The amount they offer is considerable, and the northwest territories are of limited value to us, but it is almost an insult that they would think us so eager to give up our rightful territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44125;Mexico is not properly utilizing the lands between ours and the Pacific. It is our destiny to bring American rule and prosperity to all of North America, and our responsibility to take these lands from Mexico so they may flourish. To avoid further war with Mexico, we should approach their government and see if they will consider selling these lands to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC38505;The death of Sa'id bin Sultan Al-Busaid has left him with two sons, each of which has claimed Oman as their own to rule.

EVTDESC37751;As impossible as it seems, we have lost the war against the Spanish. They retain their hold over Cuba and their other colonies. The American people are understandably shaken, but it seems their jingoistic fervor has only increased. A streak of anti-colonialism has arisen throughout the country, specifically targeting the powers of 'Old Europe'. Newspapers are demanding we gear up to liberate these colonies once and for all. If we agree, some fear this may be a tiger we cannot again cage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37750;We have lost the war with the Americans,and Cuba has been wrested from our grasp. The American government has approached us intent on a treaty, suggesting we no longer have the power to hold onto our Pacific and North American colonies.

Some in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ govrnment fear that, if we do not agree, it could mean further wars with the Americans for years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37745;A heated dispute has arisen between the Moroccans and our government over the boundaries of our holdings in Melilla. Some believe the Moroccans are attempting to gain sympathy from the French, but we have it on good authority that there will be no aid coming for them. Now may be the time for us to exert some of our authority over this African upstart.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37744;The Christinos have been spreading their propaganda into neighboring $PROVINCENAME$, and reports have it that their lies are finding a ready audience among the locals.

EVTDESC37740;We are losing the war with $FROMCOUNTRY$, and it's only a matter of time before we're forced to submit to a humiliating defeat. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has made it clear it considers our colonial holdings to be beyond our ability to control, and is willing to purchase them for a 'fair' price. Failure to submit to their demands will mean the war dragging on to its inevitable conclusion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37735;The Spanish Republic has been contentious since its inception. After a series of failed governments, many Spaniards have come to favor a return to the stability of Bourbon rule. In a coup led by Brigadier General Martinez Campos, the Republican army has declared its alliegiance to Prince Alfonso, son of the exiled Queen Isabella II, and named him King of Spain.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37730;King Amadeo, controversial since his ascension and constantly balked in the royal courts by moarchists advocating a return to the Bourbon line, has angrily declared Spain to be 'ungovernable' after the Hidalgo Affair forced him into conflict with the nation's military and has abdicated the throne.

EVTDESC37725;The Hohenzollern king of Spain, controversial since his ascension to the throne and constantly balked in the royal courts by moarchists advocating a return to the Bourbon line, was shot dead in his carriage shortly after arriving in Madrid following a country outing.

EVTDESC37722;With Queen Isabella II having been deposed by a revolt, the Spanish provisional government has been busy seeking a new monarch... and the candidate they have chosen is none other than Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern.

EVTDESC37721;With Queen Isabella II having been deposed by a revolt, the Spanish provisional government has been busy seeking a new monarch to assume the throne... and among the candidates considered was Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern. Our government objected strongly to the move, as this would spread Prussian influence to our southern border, and while this did convince Prince Leopold to turn down the throne it has not endeared us to the Prussians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37720;The death of Leopoldo O'Donnell has eroded Queen Isabella's support, to the point where a movement to overthrow her has rapidly developed. A mutiny by naval officers in Cadiz has provided the spark for a widespread revolt against Isabella's rule. Her chief minister and generals have deserted her, and Isabella was forced to flee into exile. For the moment, Spain stands without a ruler, and the provisional government argues over what its next step should be. Some favor abandoning the monarchy altogether, but most feel a new king should be selected. Isabella's heir, Prince Alfonso, is thought by many to be too much under her influence. Other choices are the moderate Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern and the liberal Prince Amadeo of Savoy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC37711;The death of King Ferdinand in 1833 and the ascension of young Isabela (only three years old at the time) to the throne of Spain sparked a revolt by supporters of the King's brother, the Infante Carlos. He intends to depose Isabela and establish a separate branch of the Bourbon family, as well as restore the Spanish Empire to its traditional glory, something liberals say simply cannot be done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37710;A new line of the Bourbon family has been established on the Spanish throne, descending from the Infante Carlos. To many traditionalists, this signals a rebirth of the true Spanish Empire. Others are not so optimistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37235;Not long ago, Algerian bitterness towards Ottoman rule made them almost welcome French intervention. Our colonization of Algiers and the northern coast, however, has given rise to a resistance under the leadership of Emir Abdel Kadir.

EVTDESC37230;The island of Tahiti in the Pacific Ocean, ruled by the primitive Queen Pomare IV, expelled two French catholic priests several years ago. Admiral Abel Aubert Dupetit-Thouars was dispatched to get reparations for the deed, but then proceeded, without authorization, to gain a request from the Queen's chiefs to request a protectorate, a treaty to which he then demanded the Queen acquiesce. We can approve the treaty, gaining use of Tahiti as a staging ground in the Pacific, but it may cause friction with the British Empire considering British colonists are also on the island.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37219_NEW;The Paris Foreign Missions Society has been actively spreading Catholicism in Asia for many years now, but they have encountered considerable persecution at the hands of Asian authorities. In Dai Nam, the execution of several missionaries has prompted the society to ask the French government for diplomatic intervention. This has gone nowhere, leaving us with little choice but to consider armed intervention.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36975;We have received disturbing reports of rebellion in Egypt, on a scale where our interests in the Suez might become threatened.

EVTDESC36966;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ships have sailed into Lagos, seizing the city and driving off the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ garrison. They claim they are 'liberating' the city from slavers, extending their benevolent rule on behalf of the locals. Resisting means war, but submitting would do nothing more than prove our lack of ability to face these foreigners. What should we do?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36965;We outlawed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ slave trade many years ago, but it continues in many African nations, and the coastal city of Lagos in particular. Lagos has been a haven for slavers, providing unwilling natives to the trade on markets in defiance of all decent conventions. The notion has arisen that we should consider sending our ships in to liberate the natives there and establish a colony where they can receive civilized government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36960;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us with the hopes of negotiating a treaty.

EVTDESC36955;A British Commodore who was recently dispatched to Burma to negotiate several matters regarding the Treaty of Yandabo, signed in 1826 after the First Anglo-Burmese War, has initiated a naval confrontation with the Burmese under questionable circumstances.

EVTDESC36943;The arrival of European settlers, known locally as Pakeha, has resulted in an increasing amount of land purchased from the Maori.

EVTDESC36716;Our forces have consolidated their control over Amsterdam and proven their superiority in the war, and thus the Dutch government has little choice but to accept any terms we dictate. The European powers are pushing for peace and conciliation, they wish to see that Belgium keeps what it has and nothing more, though if we dare risk their wrath we could certainly wrest territorial considerations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36715;Despite our best efforts, the unthinkable has happened: Amsterdam has fallen. It seems there is little choice but to surrender to the Belgians and allow them to dictate terms. If they are kind, they will simply force us to relinquish all claims to the southern Netherlands. If they are unkind, they may force us to give up territory, though doing so will surely bring about the wrath of the European powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36712;The Belgian government has refuse the terms of the Treaty of London. This is a foolish move that only opens up the possibility of more war, but it seems the Belgians will not be moved.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36711;The Belgian government has agreed to the terms of the Treaty of London. We have surrendered all claims to their territory, in return for control over Luxembourg.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36710;In a meeting mediated by the British, the Netherlands has offered to sign a treaty which would see them relinquish all claims to Belgian territory, but at the cost of surrendering Luxembourg to them as a vassal. Some are claiming this is too high a price, and that we should not allow ourselves to be bullied into such a treaty... but this may also be the only chance we have at peace with the Dutch.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC36709;While Belgium's de facto independence from the Netherlands had been established by force of arms during the Belgian Revolution of 1831, it has not been confirmed de jure and we yet hold claims over Belgian territory. The British have offered to mediate a settlement, in return for the surrendering of our claims and a guarantee of Belgium's neutrality, we would receive the Rhenish part of Luxembourg as our vassal as well as a great deal of standing in the eyes of the European powers. That is, of course, if Belgium even agrees to the treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC33031;For the last several years, Swahili tribes on the coast have been making treaties with Europeans, allowing them to create small settlements. We knew this would be trouble, and we were right. Powerful warships have arrived from $FROMCOUNTRY$, a demonstration of their power as they make a demand for the entirety of the coast. If we do this, they say, we shall be safe from further molestation, and they claim we do not truly control the coast anyhow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC33030;The Society for German Colonization has been attempting to colonize the Zanzibar coast for several years now, having formed the German East Africa company and signed several treaties with Swahili tribes. It now seems they are facing difficulty with rebellions and have asked us to step in. The Sultan of Zanzibar will doubtlessly object if we do, as he claims authority over the coast, even if his actual authority is minimal, but so what if he does? This may be an interesting opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC33025;With the loss of our colonial base in Manila, the administration of the Pacific Islands has become incredibly difficult. We have been approached by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government regarding the possibility of selling any of our remaining holdings in the Caroline and Mariana Islands. The amount offered is not much, but then again the islands are not worth much, indeed, they cost us far more than they provide. There is the additional notion that, should we disagree, $FROMCOUNTRY$ might attempt to take them by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC33020;The German Kaiser has sent a delegation to $COUNTRY$ with a proposal: a resurrection of the Holy Alliance formed between Prussia, Austria and Russia which once existed after the defeat of Napoleon.

EVTDESC33009;The lands of Alsace-Lorraine rightfully belong in the hands of the German people. Perhaps the time has come to reclaim them from the French, and show the world what a united and glorious Germany can achieve?

EVTDESC32549;After ten years of imprisonment, the Tsar has felt pity for Taras Shevchenko and has pardoned him for his crimes. Although Shevchenko was ordered to the Nizhniy Novgorod area, his works are increasing in number and he has expressed a desire to go back to his native Ukraine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32548;Although exiled from his native Ukraine and his residence in Saint Petersburg, Taras Shevchenko still had quite a bit of freedom. Even though the orders from the Tsar were to prevent him from working on painting and literature, the enforcement was very lax. The Tsar still had a soft spot for Shevchenko, and so the artist continued his work. Indeed, he was sometimes assigned to the military as a sketch painter, and his travels to Khazakstan and the Urals continued to shape his world-view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC32547;Taras Shevchenko was found in the company of Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius, known dissidents against the Tsardom. During the raid of their headquarters, Shevchenko's new poem," ""The Dream""", was found. This poem personally attacked the Tsar Nicholas I and his wife. Although Tsar Nicholas personally read the poem, and was quite amused at the parts attacking him, he purportedly flew into a rage when the poem attacked his wife. Although a pardon for Shevchenko was likely, the attack against the Tsar's wife was the last straw, and Shevchenko was thrown into custody.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTDESC32546;Taras Shevchenko has been working for the past few years," but he recently made a defining piece named ""Picturesque Ukraine"". This has created a small awakening in the Ukraine", fueled by his unique paintings and stirring literature. Historically, Taras Shevchenko is even considered the father of the modern Ukrainian language and art styles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32545;Taras Shevchenko, a gifted Ukranian artist, has published his first major piece," a painting entitled ""The Beggar Boy Giving Bread to a Dog"". This piece is amazing", considering that it came from a man who until recently had been a serf. This painting seems to be stirring consciousness in Ukraine, but for now let us enjoy it for its excellence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC32542;The last pockets of resistance have foundered, the rebellion is leaderless, tens of thousands lie dead, and the Circassian/Caucasian War has finally ended after 100 years of bloodshed. The people of the Caucasus now know their place in the Russian Empire, but such wars are not that easy to forget.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC32541;Historically, Imam Shamil was captured in 1859. The Russians allowed him to live, albeit under surveillance in Kiev. The mutual respect that the Imam and the Tsar had for each other helped quite a bit in this aspect, and Imam Shamil saw the war as lost from this point. Although resistance continued in the Caucasus, the ideological centre of the movement was removed, and the ideological foundation of the resistance foundered. Imam Shamil himself received permission from the Tsar to go on the Hajj to Mecca in 1869. He briefly stopped at Istanbul where he was greeted warmly by the Ottoman Sultan, but continued on his way to Mecca. He died shortly after completing the pilgrimage in 1871, a truly remarkable figure in life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTDESC32540;Historically, soon after major victories in the Caucasus, the Russians purged the area of any undesireable elements. The ethnic cleansing continued until the 1870s, as many natives of the area were killed or deported to the Ottoman Empire. Indeed, the ethnic cleansing of the area has been considered by many historians to be the first ethnic cleansing on a modern scale and the harbinger of genocides as a concept.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC32539;A string of military and civil victories in the Caucasus has led to the breaking of most Circassian resistance! Imam Shamil is on the run and the back of the resistance is broken! It seems that the war that has raged for almost a hundred years is almost over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32538;Imam Shamil has released an ultimatum: Caucasian independence or indefinite rebellion. His troops have already seized Russian supply depots and a few outposts, and as such he has dishonourably broken our treaty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32537;There is increased unrest as of late, as Imam Shamil has begin a campaign of peaceful resistance and invective, wanting independence for his people and the Caucasus.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32536;Imam Shamil has stated his demands regarding the Caucasus: Independence, a return to the status quo of 1834, or death! Historically, the Imam and the Tsar agreed to a peace treaty, which was respected for almost a decade, as it worked out to both sides' advantage. The Russians had been humiliated at the Caucasus, but the Circassians could not hold out much longer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC32535;Although we attempted to pull out of our weaker outposts, the Circassians have ambushed our travelling forces and seized our supplies. Our larger outposts relied on these smaller reinforcements to properly defend, and we have suffered some losses in our major military and civilian centres. This perceived weakness has given the Circassians free reign to massacre our people, and has shamed us on a world scale.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32534;The Circassian resistance has managed to take out our minor outposts through sneak attacks, seizing supply depots, and what can be termed guerilla warfare. Although we have suffered much, our ready state of alertness prevented an overly large massacre of our people and has prevented our major outposts and fortresses from being overrun by the Circassians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32533;Imam Shamil has gained power and become the Imam of the Caucasian Imamate! His frequent attacks against Russian outposts throughout the region are worrisome, and a decision is needed as to what to do with his resistance movement. Historically, Imam Shamil became Imam of the Caucasian Imamate in 1834, becoming leader of the Circassian resistance against Russian occupation. He had a solid understanding of asymmetrical warfare and was honourable enough to gain the respect of the Russian Tsar and his generals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32532;Historically, soon after the conflict at Tepsue, Russian Colonel Obshevski gave a speech to the local Circassian population about the advantages of being under Russian control and the virtues of not rebelling against their Russian masters. The Circassians did not forget it, to the detriment of the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32531;The war for Sakhalin is lost! We have been compelled to agree to a humiliating peace and acknowledge Russia's sovereignty. One day, we will make this right,- but, for now, we are beaten.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32531;The Russians made a large landing at Tepsue soon after the Caucasian War restarted, intending to crush opposition in western Circassia after their successful occupation of eastern Circassia a decade earlier. Historically, the occupation was a reasonable success, yet casualties were very high on both sides and neither belligerent forgot the lessons learned during this conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32530;The war for Sakhalin is won! Russia has enforced its rule over the entire island, and the Japanese have been forced into a treaty renouncing their claims. Peace has been restored to Sakhalin!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32530;One of the first events of the restarted Caucasian War was General Volkhovski's landing in Circassia, near the modern town of Sochi. Originally plagued by setbacks due to Circassian resistance and poor organization, it was a good start and learning experience for the Russian armed forces.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32529;The war for Sakhalin is won! We have successfully defended ourselves against Russia's misguided aggression, and the Russians have been forced into a treaty acknowledging Japanese sovereignty. Peace has been restored to Sakhalin!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32528;The war for Sakhalin is lost! Russia has been compelled to acknowledge Japan's sovereignty over the south of the island. One day, we will make this right,- but, for now, we are beaten.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32527;The treaty has been signed! Our borders in Sakhalin and the Kurils are now settled, and ships from both empires have been guaranteed access through the Strait of Tartary and the Sea of Okhotsk. This should ease tensions in the region considerably and ensure close diplomatic ties between our nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32526;The Japanese have refused our proposal, and they now insist that they will settle for nothing less than the present division of Sakhalin. We can back down and accept the status quo, or we can use force to get our way. If we accept the status quo after reaching for more, we will look weak to the other Powers, though relations with Japan will be preserved. But, our only other option now is to declare aggressive war for the islands, which will hurt our reputation abroad.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32525;It seems conflict is brewing in Sakhalin. Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian claims and ours, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. Now the Russians have outrageously demanded that we give them full control of Sakhalin, in exchange for nothing! Their negotiators hint darkly at Russian ships shelling Japanese ports if we should refuse. We can accept their proposal, or we can insist on preserving the present borders in Sakhalin. If we give in, we will lose a promising colony and look weak to other nations. But, if we insist on the status quo, the conflict is likely to escalate into open war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC32524;It seems that conflict is brewing in Sakhalin. Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian claims and ours, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. Now the Russians have proposed an exchange of border territories: we would give them complete control of Sakhalin, and in return they would cede the northern Kuril Islands all the way to Kamchatka. Russia has also offered to make resettlement payments to help Japanese to relocate from Sakhalin. We can accept their proposal, or we can insist on preserving the present borders in Sakhalin.If we accept, we will lose a modest territory but improve relations with Russia. On the other hand, if we insist on the status quo, we will keep our present territory but risk escalating the conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC32523;It seems that conflict is brewing in Sakhalin. Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian claims and ours, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. The Russian recently approached us, all smiles and willingness to co-operate. They have offered to make the current status quo official: Sakhalin will have a border drawn dividing it in two. Considering the fact they could have forced the issue, it seems they want us to be friends rather than enemies.;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32522;Conflict is brewing in Sakhalin. Shared sovereignty has failed, and with no official border between the Russian and Japanese claims, settlers from both sides now fight over territory. For stability's sake, we must clearly define our borders, once and for all. There are several solutions we could propose: first, we could officially divide the island between us and Japan, essentially legalising the status quo. This would be generous of us, and it would improve our relations with Japan. Second, we could push for full control of Sakhalin, offering in return to concede the northern Kuril Islands and make resettlement payments to those displaced. This would represent a modest profit, but Japan might not agree to it. Finally, we could demand full control of Sakhalin and offer nothing in return. This would hurt our reputation, and it would badly offend the Japanese, who would probably refuse. How should our diplomats proceed?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC32521;Vice-Admiral Yevfimy Putiatin has sailed from Russia to $COUNTRY$ on a mission to establish formal relations and to define the borders between our respective territories. After months of negotiation, we have agreed to open three ports to Russian merchants and to guarantee Russian ships access through $COUNTRY_ADJ$ waters and straits. Both sides have agreed that our borders in the Kuril Islands lay just north of Etorofu, and propose to share sovereignty over Sakhalin Island. The finished treaty was signed on February 7th, $YEAR$ in Shimoda.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32520;The islands of Sakhalin and the Kurils are a natural extension of our holdings in Okhotsk and Kamchatka, and we must seek to claim these lands before the Japanese do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32516;Russia has refused to sign the Treaty of Tartu, raising the spectre of war between our nations. Perhaps we should consider surrendering southern Karelia before the Russians come and take it from us?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32515;Now that Finland is free from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule, their government has approached us to engage in territorial talks. They are interested in the northern strip of land known as Petsamo, and the access to the Arctic Ocean it offers, as well as discussing Russian claims to Viipuri. If we give them what they're looking for, $COUNTRY$ looks good in the eyes of the international community and we gain an ally, but perhaps we do not need Finland as an ally?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32513;The Russian annexation of the Caucasus twenty years ago has met with increasing bitterness and anger among the local populace, tribal groups that are angry with the Russian administration and have declared that their homelands shall be freed from our rule. This has become a problem as rebels take to the highlands, and rooting them out may take a very long time indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC32512;The Hungarian revolution in Bohemia sets a dangerous precedent. There are far too many minorities in $COUNTRY$ who might look to the Hungarians as an inspiration, and who would rise up as well if we do not set a firm example. No matter our relation with the Bohemian government, we must consider intervention against the Hungarian rebels or possibly face similar uprisings at home.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31531;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. While such a nation would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would likely object to such a union. Is Greater Germany worth the possibility of war?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31530;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering such a union could alarm the powers of Europe to a great degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31521;Austria is no more. With Vienna gone and what remains of the Empire a disarray of governments unwilling to maintain their cohesion without an Austrian government to hold it together, the nation has split apart at the seams. Whole portions of the Empire have either declared their outright independence or their intention to reunite with their homelands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31519;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. Their only stipulation on the union is that their non-German states be incorporated as self-governing regions, no doubt to minimize the objection of European powers-- though there are those who believe the European powers will be unhappy with such an arrangement even so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31518;There has been much talk in $CAPITAL$ in recent days of possible unification with $FROMCOUNTRY$ into a 'Greater Germany'. This talk was finally shot down by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, which stated that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s path is separate from $COUNTRY$'s. There are those within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, however, who believe this is unacceptable. While it would undoubtedly destroy our relationship with $FROMCOUNTRY$ and upset the powers of Europe, laying a claim to the German-speaking parts of $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31516;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government met with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government in $CAPITAL$ today, expressing their desire to unite into a 'Greater Germany'. They do so with the full intent of incorporating not only their German-speaking territories, but also any lands they own belonging to other cultures. While such a Greater Germany would undoubtedly be a power unheard-of in the world, there are those who express caution: the world's great powers would almost certainly object to such a union, not to mention the fact that the non-Germany cultures would likely rebel against our dominance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC31515;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who question that path, citing the ascension of a great power who stands ready to lead us into a Greater Germany. Considering that non-German cultures within Austria would never accept dominance by such a union, and that it would alarm European powers to an unprecedented degree, we have to wonder where our path should now lie?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC31511;We have been granted limited self-government by $FROMCOUNTRY$, in the interest of gaining our acquiescence to their formation of a Greater Germany. There are those within $COUNTRY$ who object, saying that being a German vassal is no better than what we enjoyed previously. But it is something.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC31510;Austrians have always walked a path slightly apart from those of their fellow Germans, and the notion of greater unification has never caught on in Austria as it has in the north. Lately there are those who say Austria's unquestioned dominance obligates it to unite Greater Germany under a single flag. Still others say that, no, Austria already has its own name and empire, one that stretches over many cultures who would never welcome becoming more dominated by the Germans... not to mention that a Greater Germany would alarm the powers of Europe to such a degree it would almost surely herald a war. Thus the question arises: what shall our path be?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC20115;A demonstration by $PROVINCECULTURE$ citizens in $PROVINCENAME$ quickly got out of hand as $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers shot into the crowd to disperse it. A riot ensued, and several protestors were slain. Throughout $STATENAME$, the reaction has been one of outrage, and there is an effort by some $PROVINCECULTURE$ malcontents to draw the attention of the world, just one more example of $COUNTRY$'s disregard for peace and civilized behavior, or so they'll say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC20112;While recent trouble in $STATENAME$ has raised the spectre of foreign intervention once again, there are many who remember the last crisis over $STATENAME$'s people as if it were yesterday. Try as they might, the world is simply not ready to listen to them again, yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC20111;A recent riot in $PROVINCENAME$ has brought a great deal of attention to $STATENAME$, the kind that would normally prompt the great powers to consider intervention. It seems, however, that the demands for independence by 'uncivilized' peoples has largely fallen on deaf ears. News of the trouble has faded away as quickly as it began.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC20110;A recent demonstration in $PROVINCENAME$ has brought attention to the plight of natives in $STATENAME$, namely to their oppression by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and their demands for independence. If something isn't done soon we may be facing intervention by foreign powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19370;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ soldiers marched into $CAPITAL$ today, accompanying the new $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ governor who will be overseeing the operation of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ puppet government. Already the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are up in arms over this imposition by a foreign power, though some are clearly questioning whether there is anything to be done. $COUNTRY$ did not submit willingly, after all, and if a rebellion breaks us free of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ control would they not simply invade once again? Perhaps $COUNTRY$ has suffered enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19368;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to intervene on our behalf. Worse, it appears the purpose of our mission has leaked to at least one of our neighbours, angering them greatly bringing threats of war against $COUNTRY$. Did $FROMCOUNTRY$ inform them? Have we been abandoned by our ally?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19367;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to consider our proposal. It's possible they will, in the end, take no military action on our behalf it's come to our attention that relations between them and one of our neighbours has cooled severely, however, so a war may yet come to pass.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19366;Diplomats from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have quietly approached us, appealing for help in restoring their lost lands. With $COUNTRY_ADJ$, they say, $FROMCOUNTRY$ will prove a much worthier ally. There are those concerned with the trouble this might stir up, however. Should we look the other way, our prove $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence has weight?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19365;An idea has been spreading among the people of $COUNTRY$... some of our lands are under foreign control, but it appears to be beyond our power to regain them on our own. $COUNTRY$ has a great power as its benevolent protector, however, does it not?

EVTDESC19046;...opening the inner granite lid leading into the tomb, I was met by a breath of air that had been left undisturbed for some three thousand years. To the best of my knowledge, I was the first to disturb the Pharaoh's sleep since he was laid to rest all those thousand years ago.

EVTDESC19045;How it started, we do not know, but what we do know is that what was once a rumor has now become public wisdom.

It is a hysterical rumor, of course, but the hysteria is there nevertheless.;;;;;;;;;;x;,,,,,

EVTDESC19043;Egyptian officials in Alexandria have refused our Egyptian Expedition to unload vital excavation equipment in the Alexandrian port.

EVTDESC19040;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has requested excavation rights in the Valley of The Kings. While we ourselves do not have the know how or money to fund a serious excavation of the area, and allowing a foreign contractor might be good for that reason, it might also be best to let the secrets of our proud nation's history lie undisturbed until such a time when we ourselves can find them. Turning down a foreign power will spoil our relations, though.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19007;Tensions between ourselves and other Great Powers have erupted regarding dominance over the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government. We are forced into a position where we must either assert our position, which will be seen as undercutting $FROMCOUNTRY$'s independence, or back down and lose much of the influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ we currently hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC19006;Our independence is gradually being undercut and more and more becoming something that only exists on paper, as several foreign Great Powers vie for control over our political institutions. Recently, tensions have erupted between several great powers each vying for dominance over our government. If any of them attempts to assert themselves in $COUNTRY$, it will mean conflict with our government, the other great powers, and possibly even war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18571;We never wanted this contact with the westerners. They bring too many problems into our country, and their influence spreads like an insidious disease. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ court are calling for the borders to be closed once again, for us to display to these imperialists that they cannot simply strut about our nation as if they own it. A display of force is necessary!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18565;$COUNTRY$ is a nation of progress, and our current period of insulation against the western powers runs contrary to that ideal. Shall we call on the borders to be opened once again? It might anger some of our people, but the flow of goods and ideas is invaluable to our prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18562;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ reactionaries have begun heated debates in one of our states, arguing that $COUNTRY$ should not be slavishly seeking to chase after 'civilized' nations-- indeed, that already $COUNTRY$ has gone too far down the path of degradation and that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people suffer for it. They are calling on the government to repeal reforms, or at the very least to slow down the rapid pace of change... and they are gaining a wide audience.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18561;A great celebration has been held in $CAPITAL$ in honor of $COUNTRY$'s rulers, as well as its centuries of honorable tradition. Massive crowds appeared to cheer on our soldiers, and the spectacle has even drawn the attention of foreigners. Shall we dedicate the celebration to $COUNTRY$'s greatness, or shall we instead use it as an excuse to appease the masses?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18560;The peasants are taking to the streets, rising up against their rulers in ways that would have been unthinkable only decades ago. Perhaps it is time to remind them of their duty to their nation, and of the traditions which have served $COUNTRY$ so well in ages past?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18556;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ intellectuals have brought several new ideas before the court, ideas that could advance our research considerably. They are also quite contentious, however, and a rejection of the intellectuals could do much to soothe the aristocracy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18555;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ intellectuals have clashed with members of the aristocracy in $CAPITAL$. The aristocracy has accused the intellectual elite of attempting to cast aside the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life, while the intellectuals say that progress is necessary if $COUNTRY$ is to have any chance against western imperialist powers. The argument of the intellectuals is convincing, but this has not calmed matters in the streets.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18551;Our people have held to our traditions for a very long time. After many years of exposure to the western nations, however, a growing movement has begun to change the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life. Intellectuals in $CAPITAL$ say the government should lead the people into an era of progress and not remain mired in our backward ways. Shall we throw these fools into prison, or consider what they have to say?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18550;Our people have attempted to embrace the ideals of westernization for a long time, but now there is a growing movement to return to the traditional $COUNTRY_ADJ$ way of life. It falls to the nation's leaders to set the example: should we embrace the ideal of tradition once again, or should westernization remain our goal despite our continuing isolation?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC18517;Ours is a nation of order, where peace and civility rule the day. Everyone strives for the common good, and for the progress of our nation as a whole. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the arrest of a prominent criminal figure who had previously eluded authorities has not outraged the people, but rather has served to reinforce their beliefs. Today the people of $COUNTRY$ walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18515;Matters in $COUNTRY$ are getting out of hand. Acts of violence are becoming more commonplace, and some claim that revolution is in the air. Many citizens in $CAPITAL$ are calling on the government to take stronger measures. Sending our army to deal with the violence will, however, only bring the attention of the world upon us. Perhaps this is a time to prove that $COUNTRY$ can deal with its affairs in the way we always have-- with civility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18511;Ours is a nation of might, where a man's strength determines his success and everyone knows very well how superior we are to our neighbours. None can hope to compare to $COUNTRY$ on our best day. A recent report in a $CAPITAL$ newspaper regarding the execution of a foreigner believed to have been engaged in criminal activities on $COUNTRY_ADJ$ soil has served to reinforce our peoples' beliefs.

EVTDESC18510;In the eyes of our soldiers as they parade through the streets, nothing can be seen but utmost devotion to $COUNTRYNAME$ and the ideals for which our nation stands.

Long live $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18507;It has been often said that the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are accustomed to freedom-- they strive for it, hold it as the greatest of ideals. So it is that they chafe under the yoke of what they see as the government's tyranny. A recent demonstration in one of our cities threatens to spread throughout the state. With the eyes of the world upon us, however, forcefully putting an end to this act of civil disobedience will no doubt be seen as an attack upon our own citizens.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18506;Ours is a nation of liberty, where every man is born with the inherent right to seek his own destiny. The possibility of prosperity lies within every man's reach.

Today they walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18501;Ours is a nation of equality, where no man is placed above another in importance. Everyone strives for the betterment of all.

Today our people walk a little more proudly than before.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18230;Members of the ruling party have been busy within the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, slowly changing small rules that would make it difficult for opposition parties to get recognized and elected. Political boundaries have been shifted, and in some cases members of the opposition have even been harassed. Now it seems a bill has been put before the government which would entrench a large number of these rules, making them permanent. The government is adamant, saying the rules are needed to keep stability in $COUNTRY$, though the bill will no doubt be incredibly unpopular among the liberals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18225;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the people to gather. Many feel that reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people to become too liberated-- they gather in crowds, protesting the government and otherwise stirring the rest of the rabble. Once upon a time, they say, this simply wouldn't have been allowed. New rules must be put in place to limit the number of people that can meet in one place, and for what purpose. While some might be upset by the bill's passing, the government appears entrenched in its position.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC18220;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the rights of the press. Many feel that the reforms have allowed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ newspapers to become combative with the government, inciting dissension and making the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people harder to control. This control is necessary, they say, if $COUNTRY$ is to remain strong and united. While some might be upset by the bill's passing, the government appears entrenched in its position.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC18215;A group of the ruling elite in $CAPITAL$ has recently become very concerned at reforms which have made it possible for members of the government to hold views outside of party policies. These reforms have made things too lax, they say, and will ultimately lead to the demise of $COUNTRY$.

EVTDESC18210;A bill has come before the government in $CAPITAL$ regarding the current enfranchisement offered to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people. The discussion so far has been that expanding the voter base has led only to problems, and this bill would tighten the restrictions on voting... to the point where entire groups of people would have their voting rights removed. Passing the bill would no doubt cause problems, but the government seems determined to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC17730;A communist demonstration in the streets of $PROVINCENAME$, with shouts decrying the state of workers in $COUNTRY$, has gained the communists a great deal of attention and sympathy throughout $STATENAME$. Attempting to crack down on these agitators may only cause the demonstrations to turn into violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC17720;The tense situation in one of our states has been aggravated by the presence of communist agitators, spurring on the working classes to rise up against the government and institute a rule by the workers.

Allowing the agitators to continue spreading their propaganda, however, might let them get a stronger foothold in $COUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC17715;Socialist leanings have become quite prevalent in parts of $COUNTRY$, and among these socialists radical ideas have been spreading-- namely that the common man can only achieve true freedom by overthrowing the government and establishing a rule by the working class.

EVTDESC17710;Communists have been distributing literature among the working classes in one of our states. They are claiming that the common man needs to rise up against the 'bourgeois' class, and that rule by the workers is the only way they can obtain fair conditions and a truly utopian society.

We could issue a decree stating that the government will have no part in guiding the people during the decision. That way they can make up their minds on their own. Of course, this would make it less possible for us to influence the elections.;;;;;;;;;;;x

The diplomatic attaché insists that the sailor be handed over to the country in question, and tried according to their laws. This presents us with a conundrum.

EVTDESC13056;The great clippers ply our coastlines from north to south, like wolves culling out the weak and the corruptible with the poison they sell. Wherever there is an unexposed harbor, a foreign ship soon docks, and drives another fang into our national body. The use of opium has spread throughout $STATENAME$.;Les grands voiliers de commerce sillonent nos côtes du nord au sud, comme des loups à l'abattage des faibles et des corruptibles avec le poison qu'ils vendent. Partout où il y a un port non encore exposé, un navire étranger accoste bientôt, et plante un autre croc dans notre organisme national. L'usage de l'opium s'est étendue à $PROVINCENAME$. ;Die großen Klipper fahren unsere Küste von Norden nach Süden ab, wie Wölfe, die sich die Schwächsten aus der Herde suchen - in diesem Fall die mit ihrem wohlfeilen Gift Korrumpierbaren.

Der Opiumgebrauch hat sich nach $PROVINCENAME$ ausgebreitet.;;Los grandes veleros clíper navegan por nuestras costas, recorriéndolas de norte a sur, como lobos que acechan a los débiles y corruptibles con el veneno que venden.

EVTDESC13051;Due to the trade restrictions on the sale of opium, a number of western merchants have instead gone underground. We have word that a group of them have set up shop in one of our coastal provinces, but so far none of the locals seem willing to come forth with information. If we allow the smuggling ring to remain, it seems only a matter of time before the opium problem spreads.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC13050;A sweet, pungent stench hangs over the backstreets and alleys in one of our cities, emanating and spreading in every direction from an epicenter at the foreign trade station. The European traders have brought with them the habit of opium smoking, and our subjects have taken to it on a scale that threatens to become epidemic. It seems that, for every new ship that lands, more and more of our people get caught in the deadly and pacifying web of addiction. What should we do?;;Ein süßlich-stechender Gestank hängt über den Hintergassen und -gossen in $PROVINCENAME$ und verbreitet sich von einem Epizentrum an der ausländischen Handelsstation in alle Richtungen aus. Die europäischen Händler haben die Gewohnheit des Opiumrauchens mit sich gebracht, und unsere Untertanen haben sie auf eine Stufe erhöht, die zu einer Epidemie zu werden droht. Es scheint, dass mit jedem neuen Schiff, das ankert, mehr und mehr unserer Untertanen sich im tödlichen Netz der Sucht verstricken. Was sollen wir tun?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC13040;Despite the obvious rightness of our country's trade policies, greater amounts of foreign goods could be useful, and elements within our administration have suggested setting up a limited trading post in one of our coastal cities, where foreign ships can moor and trade, without compromising the cultural integrity of $COUNTRY$. It could be an economic boon to the area and the nation, but conservative voices warn that destructive foreign influences might further creep into our society.;;Trotz der offensichtlichen Richtigkeit unserer Isolationspolitik könnte eine gewisse Menge ausländischer Güter uns von Nutzen sein. Einige Elements in unserer Regierung haben vorgeschladen, einen beschränkten Handelsposten in $PROVINCENAME$ zu errichten, wo ausländische Schiffe ankern und handeln können, ohne im Großen und Ganzen unsere Politik der Separation vom Rest der Welt außerhalb $COUNTRYNAME$ zu kompromittieren. Es könnte für das Gebiet wie auch die Nation einen wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung bedeuten, aber konservative Stimmen warnen, dass destruktive ausländische Einflüsse sich in unsere Gesellschaft einschleichen könnten.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC13031;A group of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens who left $COUNTRY$ some time ago on an expedition to $FROMCOUNTRY$ has been viciously refused entry to the country. It appears that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has turned gradually to a policy of increasing isolationism, most likely in order to avoid the pains of modernizing their political, economical and social institutions. This policy of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is, obviously, impairing the advances of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ trade, diplomacy and missionary activities in the region, and must be considered an unjust restriction of the international freedom of movement.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC13030;News reaches us that an expatriate community of foreigners, from various European countries and Great Powers, has formed in one of our cities. Doubtlessly, this is a direct effect of our government's policy of open ports and borders. This influx might be positive, as our government seems to believe, however some voices have less kind things to say about the foreigners.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC13021;We have received reports that a number of our missionaries have been executed in $FROMCOUNTRY$, part of a $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ action to round up all unwanted foreigners. The missionaries were peaceful, and the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ public is understandably enraged. Many believe that war is necessary, while others believe the potential for war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ simply isn't worth it. The missionaries knew they were not permitted in $FROMCOUNTRY$, after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC13020;Despite our policy of not permitting foreigners into $COUNTRY$, it has been discovered that a group of foreign missionaries has been traveling among our people and spreading their religion. While we have every right to execute them out of hand, this does raise the possibility of a confrontation with their home country. Do we wish to risk such a war, all for the sake of a few priests?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC13016;In what should come as no surprise, the foreign smuggling ring in one of our provinces has been caught red-handed selling opium to the locals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC13015;One of our subjects has been discovered wearing foreign clothes, and further interrogation by the authorities has lead to the slow unraveling of a foreign smuggling ring.

EVTDESC13010;An old pond\nA frog jumps in \nThe sound of water.'\n\n, Matsuo Basho\n\nOne of our coastal provinces is bustling with rumors about the strange people who were found along its shorelines earlier this morning. The more precise origin of these shipwrecked sailors is as of yet uncertain, but, wherever they are from, they are definitely not from $COUNTRY$. The difficulty now lies in deciding what to do with them: if we send them home, we are effectively changing our policy of non-interaction with the westerners. Ignoring them and allowing them to stay, however, means permitting a western presence in $COUNTRY$ despite all our efforts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC11120;The call has come to $COUNTRY$ to unite with Yugoslavia, a union of Slavic countries interested in protecting the Balkans from the encroachment of other European powers. Whether a union of cultures which have before now often been at war, and indeed still have considerable enmity for each other, will be difficult to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC11115;Many within the $COUNTRY$ have always considered it a dream to form a greater union of the Slavic peoples, one spanning all of the Balkans and uniting them under a common flag. Such a nation would be far better suited at resisting the encroachment of foreign powers into the region. Now seems like the perfect opportunity for $COUNTRY$ to form such a union. Do we proceed with the creation of Yugoslavia, or let the dream die here?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC11110;An open discussion amongst liberals in $COUNTRY$ has been occurring regarding the formation of a confederation of North German states. Conditions have never been right for it in the past, but many believe such a union is needed if the Germans are ever to have true security and take their place among the powers of the world. A $COUNTRY_ADJ$-led movement to create such a confederation might go over well with our neighbours, if we made the attempt to create it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC11109;The call has gone out for the Ugric nations of Greater Finland to finally unite under a common banner, to resist the encroachment of the Russians as well as other European powers.

EVTDESC11106;$MONARCHTITLE$, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ ambassador has presented us with news from the recent parliament of German revolutionaries. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to assemble a federation of German states, with the goal of eventually forming a greater Germany. If we do not agree,it is possible that $FROMCOUNTRY$ will attempt to take our lands by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC11104;A pro-$UNION_ADJ$ revolution has taken hold in $FROMCOUNTRY$. Its liberal leaders believe that $COUNTRY$ is the nation best-suited to unite all of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$, and thus have sworn to support us until the union is ready to occur.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC11100_NEW;A rising tide of liberal nationalism within $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ has begun to spread, raising the idea of a $UNION_ADJ$ union with $COUNTRY$ at its head. A parliament of liberal revolutionaries has been convened, with representatives from throughout $UNION_ADJ$ lands, which has decreed the time is right for the nation to unite under one banner. The parliament has offered the crown of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ to us. We could accept the offer, but doing so would cause international alarm, and require us to compensate the revolutionaries politically.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10411;Louis-Napoleon has grown ill in recent months, slowly surrendering more and more ground to the Upper House. Thus his death comes with no surprise to many. Mourned by the entire nation, and by his beloved Empress Eugénie, the question now turns to who will follow him. His son and heir would be Napoleon IV but he is still a young man, eager to live up to the legacy left him. Others favor the popular Bourbon Count of Paris. Still more, however, claim this is the perfect moment to restore the republic and end the monarchy once and for all.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10410;The popularity of Louis-Napoleon has waned. Where once it was expected that his ascension would return France to the greatness it experienced during the reign of his uncle, instead France sees itself being eclipsed by its neighbours. The Emperor has cultivated many enemies among the liberals in Paris, and now they have chosen their moment to strike. Napoleon has been deposed, and the only question remains as to what form France shall now take. Shall we restore the Bourbon dynasty under the Count of Chambord, elect for a Bourbon constitutional monarchy under the Comte de Paris, or instead opt to create the Third Republic?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10405;Unable to force the Upper House to repeal its prohibition against presidential re-election and facing removal from power, the popular Louis-Napoleon has launched a coup d'etat and overthrown the French government. Loyal members of the army have locked down strategic locations in Paris, and the Assemblée Nationale has been dissolved, leaving Louis-Napoleon as the undisputed ruler of the country. He has been christened Napoléon III, regaining his uncle's throne as the Emperor of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10402;Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte has swept into power as France's new Head of State. The man carries with him the legacy of his infamous uncle, and with it the support of the masses. He has no friends in Paris, however, almost all of whom are nervous of the possibility that he might decide to follow in his uncle's footsteps.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10401;While it was expected that Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte would do well in the French presidential election, no one could have counted on the fact that he has done as well as this. Despite his autocratic leanings and lack of allies in Paris, he has managed to be something to everyone even gaining the sponsorship of the Orleanists. The provisional government's candidate, Louis-Eugène Cavaignac, led the effort to quell an uprising in the city, leading to resentment among the masses which has translated into Napoleon's landslide. Many fear the man takes too much after his infamous uncle, and thus the idea has arisen of fixing the elections to ensure Cavaignac's victory. This would require us to restrict universal sufferage, as well as muffle the newspapers and political opponents. Either way, the ideals of the Second Republic seem at risk of compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10400;The unrest in France hit its height recently, with crowds streaming through the streets of Paris and erecting barricades. In what was widely regarded as an accident, a French guardsmen fired his musket on the citizens and set off a massacre. The resulting conflagaration has swept the city, with crowds chanting 'Long live the Reform!' and 'Down with the King!'. Despite assurances that everything is under control, the king has abdicated and fled the country leaving a provisional government to step in and declare the Second Republic.\n\nNow we have the task of building this new government, starting with a presidential election to determine its new Head of State. Considering the popularity of Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte among the masses, and the granting of universal voting rights, some are concerned that he may in fact take the leadership. If he does, who knows what this may mean for France?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10231;Hungarian nationalists have become increasingly vocal in recent months at the unjust rulership that our supposedly democratic country has over them without their consent or participation. They have recently taken up arms and assaulted government officials and attacked our offices. If we are to call ourselves a democratic country, better than the absolute monarchy which we had until recently, then we must recognise our own failings and accommodate these people.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10229;With the people seemingly ready to break down our doors, demanding constitutional reform, perhaps we should consider giving it to them? Some moderate reforms, allowing the masses their vote but retaining ultimate power for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocracy and the Kaiser, should please them enough to dispel this rabble... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10228;With the entire nation ready to overthrow the monarchy, ministers have approached the King with advice on reforming the constitution before it's too late. The loss of Belgium has made a revision necessary already. Including provisions that permitted the direct election of the lower house as well as numerous freedoms the Dutch do not already enjoy might pacify the liberals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10227;Hungarian lands rightfully belong to us. With their new-found freedom, we are left with the decision whether we should pursue our claim to their lands or instead try to reconcile with the Hungarian government. If they remain hostile, after all, and we are unable to defeat them, they will become a very dangerous enemy on our border. Admitting their loss, however, might be a blow to our prestige we will never recover from.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10224;Angered by the inability of France to prevent the formation of Germany, as well as the humiliating loss of Alsace-Lorraine, the government has deposed Emperor Napoleon. We must choose what form our new government is to take.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10223;Facing the prospect of losing the presidential election, the popular Louis-Napoleon has launched a coup d'etat and overthrown the French government.

He has been christened Napoléon III, regaining his uncle's throne as the Emperor of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10222;Angry crowds have flooded the streets of Paris, shouting cries of 'Down with the King!' and 'Long live the Reform!'. They have erected barricades in the streets and fighting has broken out with the Parisian municipal guards. With the city having been completely closed off from outside help, these crowds have begun to march on the royal palace. Our king has had no choice but to abdicate and flee the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10221;A massive demonstration by the Chartists has taken place in Kennington Common, with liberals demanding that the People's Charter be implemented immediately, giving equal votes to all men, rich or poor, as well as secret ballots and a fair distribution of constituencies. Many in the government are suggesting that such public gatherings should be made illegal, and that at best the British government should make empty promises to these rabble-rousers. Others fear that refusing their demands will lead to the monarchy being toppled by rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10220;The sound of rain falling on the deserted square is deafening. A tattered pamphlet, thrown in the gutter -- the ink running out across the paper in soft blueish blooms -- is the only thing that still serves as proof that $PROVINCENAME$ was, up until just recently, a hotbed of liberal agitation. Depicted on the pamphlet is Lady Liberty, the iconographic personification of the Hispanian revolution, holding a republican cantoned flag. The pamphlet reads: 'Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood -- $COUNTRY$'. It is soon swept away by the rain and down into the sewers whence it came.;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC10216;Nationalists in $PROVINCENAME$, inspired by the wave of liberalism throughout $COUNTRY$, have risen up.

EVTDESC10200_NEW;Death to the $MONARCHTITLE$!', a hoarse voice cries. The streets in $PROVINCENAME$ have come alive. A local injustice, or the perception of one, have animated the unwashed masses into rebellion against our rule and threatens to spread to the rest of the state.

Far away in the depths of the city, in the deepest bowels of the industrial machine, the cries and shouts of a forming mob can be heard echoing against a backdrop of drainpipes and smokestacks.

EVTDESC10140_NEW;Liberal causes have started to gain traction in $COUNTRY$. While no one knows for sure, rumor has it that the root cause of this sudden upswing in liberal propaganda efforts is the recent foundation of a secret society, forced into hiding due to the persecution of any legitimate opposition to the ruling party.

The events that will be recorded by history as the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Liberal Revolution of $YEAR$ are all in the past, and it seems that we have managed to weather the storm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;;;;
EVTDESC10001;Although political liberalism was defeated not much more than a decade ago in the Hispanian War (1826-1829), its ideas and its lessons could not be purged from the memory of Europeans. Throughout Europe, as old legal systems find themselves increasingly challenged by modern technology and mores, the ideas of liberalism, political reform, freedom of speech, and the rights of peoples, rather than of monarchs, are proving again the old proverb that there is no stopping an idea whose time has come. Minorities long yoked under crowns and scepters are waking up to the realization that fate is theirs to make, and, across far away oceans, the riches of Africa and Asia beckon. As the dust settles on the battlefields of Catalonia and Navarra, Europe stands again at the beginning of a new era: An age of Liberalism.;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC10000;After less than a decade of quiet following the Hispanian Revolution and its subsequent defeat, it was clear to all of Europe that the dark clouds of liberalism creeping across Europe were not harmless. The clouds broke into an angry storm as liberal agitation erupted into open revolution across the continent. The Monarchical Ancien Regimes of Europe could only look on in horror and disgust, as the hymns of the Hispanian Revolution could again be heard echoing from Europe's tumultuous streets, and students and youth again gathered under republican quartereds, celebrating the ideals, dreams and wishes of a young generation, animated by the powerful message of human liberty -- in economic, cultural, social and national affairs -- that was European Liberalism.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC2626;$FROMCOUNTRY$ continues to hold some of our lands, lands which until today have always been considered part of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ national territory.

EVTDESC2625;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag is the only one that can now be found flying in the streets of $PROVINCENAME$. At long last, it can be considered $COUNTRY_ADJ$ and only $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory.

EVTDESC2620;A parade has recently taken place in $PROVINCENAME$, with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flag flying high, and being held by people who, until very recently, likely wouldn't have considered themselves $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens at all. $PROVINCENAME$ is still claimed by another country, but the acceptance of $PROVINCENAME$'s people is going a long way towards making elimination of that an inevitable fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2616;The recent arrest of a foreign national in $PROVINCENAME$ has led to a diplomatic incident. Many of the minorities within $PROVINCENAME$ claim that the man was arrested solely because he opposed the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ assimilation policies, and was trying to spread word of a peaceful resistance. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ authorities say the man's interest was not peaceful in the least, and they suspect he in fact works for one of our neighbours with a claim on $PROVINCENAME$. Whatever the truth, the reaction has not been peaceful in the least, riots are expected, and authorities say to be wary of rebellion in the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC2615;A demonstration in $PROVINCENAME$ turned violent as minorities held up $COUNTRY_ADJ$ flags and burned them, a demonstration of their rejection of our attempts to assimilate them into $COUNTRY$.

Several ministers are accused of unsavory dealings, and there are calls in $CAPITAL$ for the government to support religious groups in their calls for moderation and temperance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC185;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Temperance League has been increasingly active in one of our states this year, with a campaign to harass local public houses and liquor merchants. Many of their more politically-minded members have even approached members of the government in $CAPITAL$, pushing for greater support for their campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVT186000DESC;Once, we may have made slavery the centrepiece of our country, but those times have passed. The time of mass labour and the slave trade is over, and we now sever all our attachments to those detestable pieces of our history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVT185000DESC;Without a leader, the Atlantic Slave Trade cannot continue. We have no choice but to end our trade, and focus on slavery within the bounds of our own country and neighbouring nations - or, should we have the power, we can lead the slave trade in place of the fools who dismantled it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVT181000DESC;With the dawn of the twentieth century, slavery in modern countries is fading away due to the prevalance of industry. A mere fifty years ago $COUNTRY_ADJ$ strength may have been founded on the backs of our slaves, but as tractors, automobiles, trains and other machines are making industry replace old mass labour, we have to make a distinct choice. Do we organize our slave economy, favouring it over industrial strength, or do we join the onward march of progress and free ourselves from the shackles that a slave society has forced us into? Just as fifty years ago a great house was divided, so now our $COUNTRY$ must become all one thing, or all the other: strong in the grip of slavery, or strong in the freedom of progress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVT180000DESC;Now that the war is over, the question arises whether or not we should allow the slaves we enlisted during the war to remain free, or send them back to work on the plantations. We made a promise to secure their freedom, but wars are a fickle thing, and some sacrifices have to be made for the betterment of the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
